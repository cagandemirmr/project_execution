When to use: Suitable for projects where finishing on time is critical and detailed task tracking is needed.

Purpose: To measure the amount of work done versus the amount of work remaining over time.

### Choose the right tracking method for your project

So far, you've learned about the importance of tracking project progress. You’ve also reviewed some of the different tracking methods used by project managers, like project plans, Gantt and Burndown charts, and Roadmaps. This reading will explore and compare these popular tracking methods in more detail so you can feel more confident choosing the best method for your projects.

**Gantt charts**
The Gantt chart is one of the most popular tracking methods and can be used for all types of projects. Gantt charts typically live in your project plan and are updated as the project progresses.

Gantt charts are useful for:

Helping a team stay on schedule

Projects with lots of tasks, dependencies, and milestones

Projects with large teams, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out visually

Asana, one of the work management software tools featured in this certification, has useful resources for getting started with Gantt charts. Practice working with Gantt charts on your own with a 



**Roadmaps**
Roadmaps are another common tracking method. Like Gantt charts, Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking big milestones in your project. 

Roadmaps are useful for:

High-level tracking of large milestones. Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key points—just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers. 

Illustrating to your team or key stakeholders how a project should evolve over time

**Burndown charts**
Burndown charts are typically used by Agile Scrum teams. Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left and how much time remains to complete the work. The main uses of a Burndown chart are to keep the project team on top of targeted completion dates and make them aware of scope creep if it occurs. The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.

Burndown charts are useful for:

Projects that require a detailed review of tasks

Projects where finishing on time is the top priority

### Project status reports
In this lesson, you are learning to identify and compare various types of tracking methods. This reading will cover project status reports and how you can use them to track and communicate common project elements in a snapshot.

Key components of a project status report
A project status report gives an overview of all of the project’s common elements and summarizes them in a snapshot. It is an efficient communication tool to convey the latest status in one place for the team and stakeholders.

**Most status reports contain the following components:**

Project name: The project name should be specific to the purpose of the project so that the overall goal of the project can be understood at-a-glance. 

Date: You will create project status reports many times during the course of a project’s implementation phase. Reports can be created weekly or monthly—it all depends on the stakeholders’ needs and pace of the project. Adding the date to each status report acts as a reference point for your audience and also creates a history log of the project’s status over time. 

Summary: The summary condenses the project’s goals, schedule, highlights, and lowlights in one central place for easy stakeholder visibility. Usually, the summary section will be followed by, or grouped with, the timeline summary and the overall project status.

**Status:** As you can imagine, status is a crucial piece. The status of the project illustrates your actual progress versus your planned progress. In project management, a common way to depict this is through RAG (red, amber, green), or Red-Yellow-Green, status reporting. RAG follows a traffic light pattern to indicate progress and status. Red indicates that there are issues that need resolution and that the project may be delayed or go significantly over budget. Amber/Yellow means that there are potential issues with schedule or budget, but that the issues can likely be resolved with corrective actions. And green means the schedule and budget are doing fine and that the project is on track. You can use RAG to indicate the overall project status, as well as milestone status. Every project team and stakeholder may have a slightly different perspective on what the colors mean and how urgent it is to escalate issues when they see an amber/yellow or red status, so it’s important to make sure everyone understands what the different color statuses mean for your project.

**Milestones and tasks:** A summary of the project’s major milestones thus far and current tasks helps the team and stakeholders easily visualize the progress of those elements. In a project plan, you will typically depict the tasks and milestones as ‘not started,’ ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’ at an item-by-item level. But, in the project status report, it is common to summarize these items into two categories to better communicate the status. You’ll use key accomplishments to detail what has happened, and upcoming to detail what big milestones you will accomplish next.

Issues: The issues include your project's current roadblocks and potential risks. Status reports are an important opportunity to set expectations with your stakeholders. If your project status is red or amber, you can flag what is preventing you from being where you planned to be. You can also use this opportunity to state your plan to get the project back to green, and ask for any resources or help you may need to do so. You will learn more about communicating big risks and issues in the upcoming videos.

**Project status report types**
With those key elements in mind, you can format your report in a variety of ways depending on your audience and what you need to communicate. 

If you need to share a status report with your team for a project that contains multiple layers of complexity, it may be best to format the report in a spreadsheet in order to keep track of all the moving parts. 

If you simply need to communicate updates to senior stakeholders, your status report may be best formatted as a slideshow, like the one below, containing only an overview of the most key points.

Example of a project status report snapshot with name, summary, status, issues, pending items and milestones and tasks
**Key takeaways**
To recap, project status reports are a powerful tool to:

Improve and simplify communication across the team.

Keep everyone, including key stakeholders, informed.

Request more resources and support (if needed).

Create structure and transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place.

### Case study: Using risk management tools

Thus far, you have learned that risk management—the process of identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential risks and issues that could impact a project—is a core part of a project manager's role. You also learned about techniques to identify potential risks and address their effects, including creating risk registers and building mitigation plans. In the following case study, we will imagine how a project manager might utilize these tools.

The project: Paw Snacks Puppy Treats
Paw Snacks is an online retailer of tasty and nutritious pet treats. Over the course of three years, the business has grown from a small startup to a 350-person organization. Paw Snacks wants to expand its offerings even further by adding a new line of treats for puppies. 

**Image of Paw Snacks dog treat**
The issue
Six weeks before the new product line is scheduled to debut, Naja, the project manager leading the launch, receives a frantic phone call from a manager at the commercial bakery hired to produce the treats. The bakery manager informs Naja that the bone-shaped cookie cutters required to shape the treats have not yet arrived. Naja knows that baking needs to start the following day in order to stay on schedule for the launch. 

Naja thanks the bakery manager for the warning and asks her teammate, Abe, to call the cookie cutter manufacturer to check on the status of their order. Abe learns that the order is delayed due to a product shortage and that the cookie cutters are now expected to arrive at the bakery two days after the original expected delivery date.

Naja recognizes that this delay threatens her team’s ability to launch their product on time. Even worse, her team doesn’t have the option to push the launch date, since the Paw Snacks marketing team has already purchased nonrefundable advertising placements for the day of the launch. Luckily, Naja and her team are already prepared for an issue like this one. 

**Planning for risks ahead of time**
Months earlier, long before the team started work on the project, Naja and her team brainstormed potential risks that could impact the project. They created a risk register, a table or chart that contains a list of risks and is often paired with a probability and impact matrix. During the process, the team determined that a delay in the cookie cutter order had a medium probability of occurring and would result in a high impact on the project. Naja added the risk to the risk register and assigned Abe to create a mitigation plan, which outlines steps to decrease the chances of a risk occurring or decrease the impact of a risk if it does occur. This plan would indicate how the team would handle an issue if it were to materialize. The mitigation plan was then approved by the project sponsor and other stakeholders.

**Managing the issue**
Now that the cookie cutter issue has occurred, Naja and Abe consult the mitigation plan for this particular risk. In this case, Abe identified two options for handling the risk: The first option is to work with the bakery to slightly increase the number of treats produced in order to make up for the two days they have lost due to the cookie cutter delay. The second option is to place an order with a second bakery to help speed up the pace of production. Naja and Abe discuss the two plans and settle on option one to avoid the work of bringing in a second bakery.

Before moving ahead with the plan, Naja and Abe meet to brainstorm potential risks associated with the new plan. Together, they determine that a smaller order of dog treats will likely have a minor—but manageable—impact on the organization’s projected growth for 2021. They determine that the best course of action is to accept the risk to avoid delaying the project further. To ensure that the project stakeholders are aware of and comfortable with this change, Naja requests a meeting with her project sponsor to communicate the plan, outline the minor risk to projected growth, and recommend accepting the risk. The sponsor agrees and approves Naja’s new plan.

Naja tasks Abe with communicating the adjusted plan to the bakery manager. Though baking begins two days behind schedule, Naja’s new plan helps ensure that the team is prepared to launch the new line on time. 

**Pro tip:** While the term mitigation plan is used more often in project management, you may also hear the term contingency plan. These terms are often used interchangeably, but there are some key differences. A mitigation plan is a planned risk response strategy. If a project manager is able to identify the potential known risks that impact any of the key project parameters (schedule, cost, or scope), they should make a plan to mitigate those risks early in the project. A contingency plan, on the other hand, is mostly related to funds the project manager keeps aside (outside of the planned project budget ) to support any of these known risk response plans if they go beyond the planned amount or to manage any unforeseen risks during execution.

**Key takeaway**
In this case study, early risk management planning enabled Naja to act quickly when an issue presented itself at a pivotal time during the project execution phase. 

By consulting an existing mitigation plan and weighing two options for moving forward, Naja and Abe were able to make an informed decision about the best path forward. Naja also communicated the growth-related risks associated with the plan to the project sponsor in a timely fashion.

As you manage projects of your own, issues will come up again and again. When you do the heavy lifting of risk management planning before starting work on the project, you will be better equipped to respond to problems quickly.

**Assessment of Exemplar**

Compare the exemplar to your completed ROAM analysis. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Let’s review each issue in the ROAM analysis: 

**Issue 1:** In response to the potting issue, you contacted the warehouse to evaluate and improve the potting process. After two weeks with no additional problems, you consider the matter resolved. 

**Issue 2:** Your team handled the customer complaints by listening to their issues and offering to send them free plants. Most of the customers were satisfied with this solution. This issue is mitigated because you reduced its impact. 

**Issue 3:** You assign your IT Specialist to fix the issue with the customer service software. This issue is owned because the IT Specialist has not yet taken action, but there is a plan in place to take care of the issue.

**Issue 4:** Some customers have called to cancel their subscriptions. Your team offered them subscription promotions, but cannot get them to reconsider. Since a few cancellations will not have a major impact, you consider this issue accepted.

**Issue 5:** To solve the delivery driver problem, you ask the HR Specialist to schedule a hiring day to hire and onboard more drivers. This issue is owned by the HR Specialist because they have not yet hired the drivers.

**Issue 6:** Your team reassessed delivery routes, which increased efficiency and reduced the number of late deliveries. This risk is mitigated because you have lessened its impact.

**Issue 7:** Your Financial Analyst reassessed spending and found more money to offset the unexpected costs, so the issue is resolved.

## Communication Issues to Stakeholders

Sorunları çözme yöntemlerinden biri de Escalation dır. Yani kendinden daha kıdemli birinden rica etmektir.

### Writing an effective escalation email
In this lesson, you are learning how to communicate risks and changes to your team and stakeholders. In the previous video, you were introduced to escalation: the process of enlisting the help of higher level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps.

There are many ways to escalate a risk, and it is important to set escalation standards with your stakeholders before beginning work on a project. In this reading, we will focus on the escalation email, and go over best practices for writing one.

**Escalation email best practices**
All projects—even those managed by experienced project managers—occasionally have problems. Your role as the project manager is to help resolve problems and remove barriers that prevent your team from making progress toward your goals. While many problems might be small enough to resolve within your core team, other problems—like a major change in your budget or timeline—may need to be brought to stakeholders for a final decision. Detailing these problems, their potential impact, and the support you need in a clear and direct email to your audience can be an effective communication tool.

Effective escalation emails:

Maintain a friendly tone

State your connection to the project

Explain the problem

Explain the consequences

Make a request

Let’s discuss these five keys to writing a strong escalation email.

**Maintain a friendly tone**
When drafting an escalation email, you may feel tempted to get straight to the point, especially when dealing with a stressful and time-sensitive problem. But keep in mind that it is important to address issues with grace. Consider opening your email with a simple show of goodwill, such as “I hope you’re doing well.” When describing the issue, aim for a blameless tone. Above all, keep the email friendly and professional. After all, you are asking for the recipient’s help. Be sure to close your email by thanking the recipient for their time.

**State your connection to the project**
Introduce yourself early in the email if you have less familiarity with the project stakeholders. Be sure to clearly state your name, role, and relationship to the project. This helps the reader understand why you are reaching out. Keep your introduction brief and to the point—a single sentence should suffice. If you know the person on the receiving end of the escalation email, you can simply reinforce your responsibility on the project before getting straight to the problem.

**Explain the problem**
Once you greet your recipient and briefly introduce yourself, explain the issue at hand. Clearly state the problem you need to solve. Provide enough context for the reader to understand the issue, but aim to keep your message as concise as possible. Avoid long, dense paragraphs that may obscure your message and tempt the reader to skim.

**Explain the consequences**
After explaining the problem, clearly outline the consequences. Describe specifically how this issue is negatively impacting the project or how it has the potential to negatively impact the project later in the project timeline. Again, keep your explanation concise and your tone friendly.

**Propose a course of action and make a request**
This is the central piece of a strong escalation email. In this section, you propose a solution (or solutions) and state what you need from the recipient. A thoughtful solution accompanied by a clear request lets the recipient know how they can help and moves you toward a resolution.

**Putting it all together**
Let’s see how these best practices come together to form a strong escalation email. In the scenario that prompts the email, Sayid, a project manager from a company that sells gift baskets, is having a quality control issue with one of the items in a line of holiday baskets. If the issue is not rectified soon, the product launch will have to be delayed and the company will lose money. In the annotated email example below, Sayid explains the issue to his internal stakeholders and requests a meeting with them.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e937342-fc35-4952-91ec-986da71bccd6)


Alternate text of email:

To: knelson@graciousgiftbaskets.com, gabrielmendoza@graciousgiftbaskets.com [Your stakeholders]

Subject: [Action required]  Decision needed to make progress on Holiday Scents project

Hi Karen and Gabriel,

[Keep it friendly and state your connection to the project]
I hope you are doing well. As you may know, I have been managing our Holiday Scents product line, which is scheduled to launch in October. 

[Explain the problem]
I would like to bring an issue to your attention. The baskets in this product line will include scented candles, and we placed an order with Candlemakers, Inc. for 5,000 candles to be delivered to the warehouse by Friday to prepare for our first customer shipment. To date, we have received 3,000 of the 5,000 candles. Unfortunately, many of the candles we have received so far fail to meet our quality standards. The packaging is damaged, or the candles themselves are broken. 

[Explain the consequences]
This puts our customer satisfaction rates at risk. Failure to meet the quality requirements for the candles by Friday will result in postponing the product launch by three weeks. If this delay occurs, we will incur an additional cost of $20,000 because we will need to order a new shipment of candles and review the quality standards of each to ensure that they meet our contractual agreements. 

[Propose a course of action and make a request]
I have sourced two backup suppliers that have five-star reviews and a track record of on-time deliveries. I propose we meet with them both right away so we can onboard one of them quickly. That way, we can avoid major delays. Are you available for a meeting tomorrow to discuss options and come to an agreement on next steps? Please respond with the times that work best for you. 

Thank you in advance for your consideration and insight,

Sayid

 End of email

**Key takeaway**
In this example, Sayid maintains a friendly tone, clearly explains the problem and its potential consequences, and makes a clear request of the recipients. The email is also brief and to the point. 

To recap, effective escalation emails apply these five best practices:

Maintain a friendly tone

State your connection to the project

Explain the problem

Explain the consequences

Make a request

Escalation is a useful skill for solving problems quickly, and sending a strong escalation email that applies these best practices can help get your team the help it needs.

### Recap: Quality management concepts
You are learning to define quality in your projects. Quality is when the outlined requirements for the deliverable are fulfilled and meet or exceed the needs and expectations of customers.

In this reading, we’ll review the four main concepts of quality management we discussed in the previous video: quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

**Quality standards** provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome. These standards must be met in order for the product, process, or service to be considered successful by the organization and the customer. You will set quality standards with your team and your customer at the beginning of your project. Well-defined standards lead to less rework and schedule delays throughout your project.

**Quality planning** involves the actions of you or your team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. During this process, you'll plan the procedures to achieve the quality standards for your project.

**Quality assurance**, or QA, is a review process that evaluates whether the project is moving toward delivering a high-quality service or product. It includes regular audits to confirm that everything is going to plan and that the necessary procedures are being followed. Quality assurance helps you make sure that you and your customers are getting the exact product you contracted for.											

**Quality control**, or QC, involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results. It includes the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified. Quality control is a subset of quality assurance activities. While QA seeks to prevent defects before they occur, QC aims to identify defects after they have happened and also entails taking corrective action to resolve these issues.

### User acceptance testing: Goals, best practices, and management
In a previous video, you learned about different ways to measure customer satisfaction, including feedback surveys and user acceptance testing (UAT). This reading will focus on why conducting UAT is essential to the successful launch of any product, service, or software. We will also discuss some best practices for effective UAT and how to manage the feedback you receive. 

**The goals of UAT**
To recap, UAT is testing that helps a business make sure that a product, service, or process works for its users. The main objectives of UAT are to:

**Demonstrate that the product**, service, or process is behaving in expected ways in real-world scenarios. 

**Show that the product**, service, or process is working as intended.

**Identify issues that need to be addressed before project completion.**

UAT simulates real-world conditions, so when the feature works as intended during the testing process, you can be more confident that your product, service, or process will work properly once it is launched. It allows a project team to gather detailed information about how users interact with a product, service, or process. UAT helps the team answer such questions as: Do users recognize its purpose and uses? How do they interact with it? How much time do users take to interact with it? Do they notice all of its features? Is the product, service, or process accessible to everyone? UAT also allows the project team to record information about how users feel about their experience with a product, service, or process. Through testing, the team can learn about the emotions it evokes, identities it conveys, appeal it holds, and so on.

**Best practices for effective UAT**
In order to achieve these goals, UAT needs to be conducted thoughtfully. These best practices can help you administer effective UAT: 

**Define and write down your acceptance criteria.** 
Acceptance criteria are pre-established standards or requirements that a product, service, or process must meet. Write down these requirements for each item that you intend to test. For example, if your project is to create a new employee handbook for your small business, you may set acceptance criteria that the handbook must be a digital PDF that is accessible on mobile devices and desktop.

**Create the test cases for each item that you are testing.**
A test case is a sequence of steps and its expected results. It usually consists of a series of actions that the user can perform to find out if the product, service, or process behaved the way it was supposed to. Continuing with the employee handbook example, you could create a test case process in which the user would click to download the PDF of the handbook on their mobile device or desktop to ensure that they could access it without issues.

**Select your users carefully.** 
It is important to choose users who will actually be the end users of the product, service, or process. 

**Write the UAT scripts based on user stories.** 
These scripts will be delivered to the users during the testing process. A user story is an informal, general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user. In our employee handbook example, a user story might be: As a new employee, I want to be able to use the handbook to easily locate the vacation policy and share it with my team via email. 

**Communicate with users and let them know what to expect.** 
If you can prepare users ahead of time, there will be fewer questions, issues, or delays during the testing process.

**Prepare the testing environment for UAT.** 
Ensure that the users have proper credentials and access, and try out these credentials ahead of time to ensure they work. 

**Provide a step-by-step plan to help guide users through the testing process.**
It will be helpful for users to have some clear, easy-to-follow instructions that will help focus their attention on the right places. You can create this plan in a digital document or spreadsheet and share with them ahead of time. 

**Compile notes in a single document and record any issues that are discovered.** 
You can create a digital spreadsheet or document that corresponds to your plan. It can have designated areas to track issues for each item that is tested, including the users’ opinions on the severity of each issue. This will help you prioritize fixes. 

**Managing UAT feedback**
Users provide feedback after performing UAT. This feedback might include positive comments, bug reports, and change requests. As the project manager, you can address the different types of feedback as follows:

**Bugs or issues:** Users might report technical issues, also known as bugs, or other types of issues after performing UAT. You can track and monitor these issues in a spreadsheet or equivalent system and prioritize which issues to fix. For instance, critical issues, such as not being able to access, download, or search the employee handbook, need to be prioritized over non-critical issues, such as feedback on the cover art of the handbook. 

**Change requests:** Sometimes the user might suggest minor changes to the product, service, or process after UAT. These types of requests or changes should also be managed and prioritized. Depending on the type and volume of the requests, you may want to share this data with your primary stakeholders, and you may also need to adjust your project timeline to implement these new requests. 

**Key takeaway**
User acceptance testing is a powerful tool to ensure that your project outcome is desirable and successful. Be sure to leave time in the schedule for proper testing and issue resolution.

### Common data metrics for project management
There are many types of project data you can use to determine your team’s progress and efficiency, evaluate the success of your project, and inform project decisions. While you don't need to be a data expert, knowing how to measure, track, and evaluate the right kind of data will help you deliver the most value and impact. 

This reading will recap some of the common types of data from the previous video and introduce a few more key data points that can help you manage projects and work with stakeholders. This reading will also introduce a few ways to interpret the data so that you can reduce risks and make the right decisions about your teams and projects.

**The benefits of analyzing data in project management**
A hand pointing at one of the bars in a bar chart.
As a project manager, you can use data daily to make better decisions, solve problems, improve performance and processes, and understand your users. 

For example, if you have data on customer buying patterns, you can identify your best-selling products, and you'll be able to make smarter decisions when placing new product orders with your suppliers. This data will also help you better understand your users and their preferences so you can improve your product offerings and performance. 

You can also use project team data to help you refine your processes. For example, if your team is experiencing an issue, analyzing data from your project tracker about the number of tasks completed, escalations, or internal process problems can help you find the source. This will allow you to make an informed decision about where to focus your efforts to improve processes.

Through critical analysis, application, and execution, data becomes a powerful tool to guide any project in the right direction.

**Data, metrics, and analytics**
Three images to represent data, metrics and analyticsThree images: Numbers grouped in a circle to represent data; a graph with rulers lining the x and y axis to represent metrics; two people working on a puzzle to represent analytics.
Data is information. It’s the numbers and feedback available to you about different aspects of your project. Metrics are how you measure your data. They define the important or specific information (data) you need to know about your project, such as productivity, quality, or engagement. Once you determine your project's metrics, you analyze the data according to those metrics to find patterns and answer questions about your project. This process is called analytics: using data to answer questions, discover relationships, and predict unknown outcomes. 

**When analyzing data, ask:** What do the metrics mean to you? How do you want to use the metrics you've chosen? Can you find patterns to make predictions about your project? Can you find ways to improve—or optimize—certain aspects of your project? What lessons can you draw from your project's data?

The next few sections are some common categories of metrics used in project management and a brief explanation of what they are and how they're useful to a project. Keep in mind that your use of different metrics isn’t limited to these categories. All of your project data is interrelated. The same metric can also provide different information when applied to different aspects of your project.

**Productivity metrics**
A calendar and clock to represent productivity
Productivity metrics typically measure progress and output over time. They allow you to track—or predict—the effectiveness and efficiency of your project team. 

To track your team's productivity over time, analyze the number of tasks or milestones completed in a given time frame. Ask questions like, what percentage of tasks are completed on time, and how long do they usually take? Or, if tasks were not completed on time, how much longer than anticipated did it take to complete all the tasks?

On-time completion rates can help illustrate to clients and stakeholders how the project is progressing and when they can expect certain deliverables to be ready. If your project's completion rates are high, it means you're doing a good job of meeting your completion goals. If the rates are low, it means you're missing deadlines. Analyzing data can help you make decisions about things like improving or implementing new processes, or re-evaluating how you estimate project scope, complexity, and timeline.

**Calculating duration (how long something takes)** can be useful for setting and evaluating tasks and milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines. Tracking task duration can improve the accuracy of estimating a project's timeline. This data is broken down into hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes years. 

You can also analyze current information to predict future outcomes and make projections (or forecasts) about productivity trends, project durations, costs, performance or quality. This kind of data empowers you to proactively manage your project and its resources and measure the accuracy of your projections over time. For example, analyzing your team's overall performance or velocity can answer questions such as, is the team completing its tasks and milestones? What percentage of tasks is the team finishing on time?

Predicting the future may be impossible, but building a better understanding of it and refining your method for making projections is achievable and valuable.

**Quality metrics**
A clipboard with a check mark 
Quality metrics relate to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics such as number of changes, issues, and cost variance, all of which affect quality.

Changes refer to differences in any aspect of the project from what was originally planned or required. Issues are problems that may affect task completion—and often result in a change. Track the number of changes and issues to identify patterns, refine processes, and share information about the project with stakeholders.

Cost or budget variance is the difference between the actual amount of money spent on a project and the amount that was budgeted for the project. Over time, this data can help you understand how well you're estimating budgets for your projects. A low variance means you've estimated your project budget accurately. A high variance means you should reevaluate your estimation process. You could be under- or over-estimating costs for your budget, or you may not be tracking expenses effectively.

**Happiness and satisfaction**
Two people smiling and giving a high-five
Project managers at Google use a sub-set of metrics called happiness metrics that also relate to quality. These are metrics that relate to different aspects of the user's overall satisfaction with a product or service, like visual appeal, how likely they are to recommend, and ease of use. Happiness metrics can generally be captured with a well-designed survey or by tracking revenue generated, customer retention, or product returns. 

**Customer satisfaction** scores reflect user attitudes, satisfaction, or perceived ease of use. These scores measure how well the project delivered what it set out to do and how well it satisfies customer and stakeholder needs. Customer satisfaction scores generally represent a combined metric—the sum of several different happiness metrics. For example, on a satisfaction survey, a customer might separately rate a product's appearance as 6/10, ease of use as 7/10, and likeness to recommend or use again as 8/10. The overall customer satisfaction score would then be 7/10. 

You will need to determine what scores are acceptable for your project by discussing with stakeholders what the most important aspects of the project are. 

**Adoption and engagement**

Another set of metrics related to quality are adoption and engagement. Adoption refers to whether or not a product, service or process is accepted and used. Engagement refers to the degree to which it is used—the frequency of use, amount of time spent using it, and the range of use. It might help to think of these in terms of throwing a party: your adoption metrics would reveal to you whether or not people accepted the invitation and showed up. The engagement metrics would tell you how active they were at the party—whether they participated in activities or interacted with other attendees, if they invited their friends to come with them, and how long they stayed. 

Adoption metrics for a product or service release, like an app, software program, delivery service, or gym membership, would be similar to the party example. However, they can be a bit more complex if you need to track metrics for more than one thing, like whether users make additional purchases or sign up for premium features. 

Each project will need to define its own set of successful adoption metrics, such as:

Conversion rates

Time to value (TTV)

Onboarding completion rates

Frequency of purchases

Providing feedback (rating the product or service)

Completing a profile

Engagement metrics tell you to what degree a product, service, or process is being used. They reveal the frequency and type of customer interaction and participation over time. Engagement metrics might include the daily usage rate of a design feature or tracking orders and customer interactions. 

As a project manager, you're not only concerned with the end user's level of engagement. It's just as important to monitor stakeholder and team member engagement as well. Measuring stakeholder participation by tracking the frequency of communication, responses to emails or updates, attendance at meetings, or level of input can give you a sense of whether or not stakeholders are finding value in the project. A lack of meaningful engagement could put your project at risk. Stakeholders may not be aware of changes or the overall progress of the project, and therefore the final outcome of the project may not meet their expectations. Measuring team member engagement is vital to the success of your project because the more engaged they are, the more productive they are, and the more likely they are to produce high-quality results. 

Ideally, you want your adoption and engagement metrics to increase or to at least meet the goal metrics that were established with stakeholders earlier in the project.  If there is no increase, or the metrics drop, then your rates are low and therefore not as successful. Check out the resources below for a more in-depth understanding of how and why to measure adoption and engagement.

**Key takeaway**
Data, metrics and analytics are all important to the success of your project. You'll need to have some familiarity with how to collect and measure data, and how to use the data to tell you about different aspects of your project. Depending on the project and its unique goals, some metrics will be more important than others. It's your job to make sure you understand which metrics your stakeholders are most interested in and what elements impact your team's ability to deliver quality results on time and within budget.

### The six steps of data analysis
In an earlier video, you learned that data analysis is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions, solve problems, make informed decisions, and support your goals. In this reading, we will go over the key parts of the data analysis process. 

There are six main steps involved in data analysis: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. Let’s break these down one by one. 

**Icon for "Ask"**
During the Ask phase, ask key questions to help frame your analysis, starting with: What is the problem? When defining the problem, look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state. Usually, there is an obstacle in the way or something wrong that needs to be fixed.  At this stage, you want to be as specific as possible. You also want to stay focused on the problem itself, not just the symptoms. For example, imagine you are doing data analysis for a gym that is losing memberships. You could ask: Why do we keep losing members? But a better and more specific question would be: What factors are negatively impacting the member experience? That way, when you set off to do your research, you know exactly what to look for.

Another part of the Ask stage is identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations. There can be lots of stakeholders on a project, and each of them can make decisions, influence actions, and weigh in on strategies. Each stakeholder will also have specific goals they want to meet. It is pretty common for a stakeholder to come to you with a problem that needs solving. But before you begin your analysis, you need to be clear about what they are asking of you. For example, if your manager assigns you a project related to analyzing the gym’s business risk, it would be a good idea to confirm whether they want you to analyze all types of risks that could affect the gym or just risks related to weather or seasonal trends.

**Icon for "prepare"**
After you have a clear direction, it is time to move to the Prepare stage. This is where you collect and store the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process. 

Let’s turn back to our gym membership example. To collect data on the member experience, you decide to send surveys to the gym’s members asking for feedback about their experience. To make sure you get specific answers, you ask them to offer feedback in three distinct categories: upkeep of the facility, customer service, and membership cost. You also leave room for them to write in a response. When you get the member surveys back, it is important that you have an organized system for tracking and filing them.   

**Icon for "Process"**
This stage is when it is time to Process your data. In this step, you will “clean” your data, which means you will enter your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, and eliminate any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.  While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any duplicate responses or biased data. This helps you know that any decisions made from the analysis are based on facts and that they are fair and unbiased. For example, if you noticed duplicate responses from a single gym member when sorting through the surveys, you would need to get rid of the copies to be sure your data set is accurate.  

During this stage, it is also important to check the data you prepared to make sure it is complete and correct and that there are no typos or other errors. 

**icon for "analyze"**
Now it is time to Analyze. In this stage, you take a close look at your data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps. Here, you will transform and organize the data in a way that highlights the full scope of the results so you can figure out what it all means. You can create visualizations using charts and graphs to determine if there are any trends or patterns within the data or any need for additional research. 

In our gym membership example, let’s say you notice 50% of the members wrote in an additional response on the survey citing that the equipment is outdated. The survey also showed that 75% of the responses cited  “expensive membership fees.” When looking at the 50% of responses citing “outdated equipment” and 75% of responses citing “expensive membership fees” side by side on a graph, you may be able to deduce that these responses inform one another. Members feel like the experience just isn’t worth the price. You might conclude that the gym should invest in new equipment if they want to keep members and add value to the membership fee. 

**Icon for "Share"**
Once you have asked questions to figure out the problem—then prepared, processed, and analyzed the data—it is time to Share your findings. In this stage, you use data visualization to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions for solving the problem. 

**Icon for "Act"**
And finally, you are ready to Act! In the final stage of your data analysis, the business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem. 

Conducting a data analysis is an essential process for understanding a business’ needs and challenges and determining effective solutions. These six foundational steps—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—will help set you up for success!

### Different ways to visualize data
Earlier, we discussed best practices for collecting and analyzing data. When it is time to present your data to your audience, you don’t just want to tell them about your findings and what they mean, you want to show them. Data visualization helps us organize data and turn it into information that is clear and easy for our audience to digest.

In this reading, we will go over a variety of charts and graphs you can use to visually represent data. 

**Visualizing your data**
Before translating your data into a chart or graph, you should be clear on what you want to show your audience. Figure out what data you want to use and why. You might want to inform your audience about a new trend or a valuable piece of information, or show relationships between data sets. Or maybe you need to compare values, understand the composition of something, or analyze trends and behaviors over set periods of time. 

The type of data you have, and the information you want to show or understand, will help you figure out the right data visualization to use. Let's go over some scenarios and discuss which charts and graphs would be best for each.  

**Show relationships**
A scatter plot, sometimes referred to as a scatter chart or scatter graph, uses dots to represent values for two different variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots will sometimes have a line drawn across its center. This line is known as the trend line and highlights the direction the points are trending towards. 

Scatter plots show the relationship between data sets, and can help us understand the impact of one factor on another. For example, the scatterplot below shows the relationship between the life expectancy of people living in a country and how happy those people are. The first variable, the happiness score, is reflected on the vertical axis —also called the y-axis. The second variable, life expectancy, is on the horizontal axis —also called the x-axis. By looking at this scatterplot, we can tell that as a person’s happiness score increases, so does their life expectancy. 

Graph of happiness on the y-axis and health on the x-axis with a line trend and dots scattered in the top right
Scatter plot best practices: 
Start the y-axis at 0 to represent data accurately.

**Comparing values**
Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values. In the example below, the time of day is compared to someone’s level of motivation throughout the whole work day. By comparing this data, we can tell that this person’s motivation is low at the beginning of the work day, and gets higher and higher by the end. Bar graphs are also a great way to clarify trends and identify patterns.

Bar graph best practices:
Use consistent colors throughout the chart

Use accent colors to highlight important data points or changes over time

Use horizontal labels so it is easier to read 

**Demonstrating composition** 
Now let’s check out another visualization you will probably recognize—the pie chart. Pie charts show us the composition of something. In other words, how much each part of something makes up the whole. The pie chart below shows us all the activities that make up someone’s day. Half of it is spent working, which is shown by the amount of space that the blue section takes up. From a quick glance at this pie chart, you can easily tell which activities make up a good chunk of the day and which ones take up less time.

Pie chart best practices: 
Avoid including too many categories so it is easy to compare slices

Make sure that the slice values add up to 100%

Order slices according to their size

**Analyzing trends and behaviors** 
Tracking trends can help us understand shifts or changes in our data. Line graphs are a great tool for visually showing change over time, but they can be paired with other factors, too. In the line graph below, we are using two lines to compare the popularity of cats and dogs over a period of time. Because the graph is using two different line colors, we can instantly tell that dogs are more popular than cats. We will talk more about using colors and patterns to make visualizations more accessible to audiences later, too. Even as the lines move up and down, there is a general trend upwards, and the line for dogs always stays higher than the line for cats.

Line graph best practices:
To avoid clutter, don't show more than four categories.

Organize highly variable data at the top of the chart to make it easy to read

### Preparing an effective presentation
At various points throughout a project, you will likely be required to deliver a presentation to team members, key stakeholders, senior leaders, or customers. Use the following tips and best practices to help you prepare an effective presentation.

Three people gathered around a presentation screen with charts
**Preparation** 
Get clear on your goals and the purpose of your presentation.
Be clear and specific about what you want to get out of the meeting, then frame the discussion with that goal in mind. For instance, “We need two engineers who have worked in this industry before,” instead of “We need more resources.” 

**Seek input and set expectations.**
Ask your manager or check with stakeholders regarding your presentation goals. Get their input and feedback ahead of time.

If you were invited to present, make sure you understand in advance exactly what the requestor is hoping to gain from your presentation.

**Create a delivery plan.**
Identify a headline for each slide, which is the one-sentence main point that you are trying to illustrate with that slide.

Create a couple of supporting points that add interest to the headline, such as anecdotes, charts, data, etc.

Build in signposts. These are ways to clue the audience in to where you are going and what to expect with your presentation.

Limit the number of slides in the main presentation. At the same time, consider creating backup slides for potential challenges, difficult questions, trade-offs, or alternative solutions. You can hide these backup slides at the end of your presentation if you don’t need them, or add them into your presentation if you do.

**Be mindful of your audience’s time.**
Invite only participants who need to be there.

Send the presentation ahead of time, if possible.

Develop a strategy for making your presentation memorable.
Use stories and repeat key points. 

Start with a strong intro. Spend extra prep time on the beginning. The beginning is when your nerves are typically the highest, and delivering the introduction successfully can help you quickly gain confidence.

**Practice**
Guide your audience through your presentation. 
Help them notice what you notice, and transition between slides by using phrases like “Building on this point . . .” or “As I mentioned before . . .”

Do a mock presentation with your team.
If there will be more than one presenter, coordinate what each person will cover and how you will manage handoffs.

Practice a question-and-answer (Q&A) session, anticipating the kinds of questions your participants might ask so you are prepared with a quick and confident response. In addition, practice what you will say if you are asked a question that you don’t know the answer to.

Be prepared to run the whole meeting yourself. If a co-presenter fails to show up, are you prepared to step in?

**Schedule time to practice.**
Once you’ve outlined what you want to say, practice it—ideally in front of a mirror—or record yourself. This may help you identify awkward phrasing that could be improved and other issues.

**Be prepared for surprises.**
Show that you can adapt and that you know your subject matter. 

If time runs short, can you quickly summarize the key points?

Can you pivot the content according to what is most important to your audience?

**Presentation and pace**
Get right to the point. 
Identify what problem you are solving and state it up front.

Tell the audience why you are in the room with them and what you will be covering.

Lay down the ground rules. For example, how do you want to handle questions and comments? Will you take them throughout your presentation or afterwards?

**Check your pace.** 
Be mindful of clues from your audience and adjust accordingly.

**Follow up**
If appropriate, send a follow up email with summary notes, action items, and time frames.

Debrief with your manager or key audience members on what they heard from the presentation.  Ask them what went well and what could have gone better.

Review next steps.

### Providing “air cover” to your team
As you have learned so far, project managers build teams that meet project goals in many different ways, from delegating responsibility and prioritizing tasks to promoting trust and psychological safety. 

But there is another skill great project managers have that we will cover in this reading: the ability to provide air cover to protect their team. Air cover refers to support for and protection of a team in the face of out-of-scope requests or criticism from leadership. 

**What is air cover?**
A lot of what we have covered throughout this program has focused on leading and managing a project team. Much of project management involves overseeing the work of others, but it also involves managing the needs and expectations of those above you. Those people are your stakeholders, project sponsors, and other leaders within your organization. 

Though the needs and requests of your stakeholders are crucial to the project’s success, there may come a time when you will need to prioritize the needs of your team over the wants of your stakeholders. This is called providing “air cover” for your team, and it is an important part of managing a project. The ability to effectively provide air cover requires a trusting relationship between a project manager and their stakeholders. In this relationship, the project manager aims to demonstrate their abilities to lead a team and communicate effectively. 

There is some risk involved in providing air cover. Sometimes a project manager provides air cover and the project team is still unable to deliver on the goals of the project. In this case, stakeholders may question the project manager’s ability to complete projects successfully. So, when preparing to defend your team against out-of-scope requests, be sure that you are confident in your team’s progress toward the project goal.

**Providing air cover: A case study**
Imagine, for example, that you are a project manager for a brand of coffee sold in supermarkets throughout your region. You and your team have been tasked with launching three new flavors of ground coffee: vanilla, hazelnut, and mocha. 

Image of three bags of coffee: one vanilla, one hazelnut and one mocha
However, well into the execution phase, your project sponsor sets a meeting with you to make an out-of-scope request: They would like to add a caramel-flavored coffee to the product lineup. Your team is already at maximum capacity preparing to launch the agreed-upon flavors, and a fourth flavor would add an unreasonable amount of work and stress to your very busy team.

Let’s discuss how you might provide air cover for your team in a situation like this one.

Saying “No” without explicitly saying “No”
One way to provide air cover to your team is to say “no” to your sponsor’s request without explicitly saying “no.” 

There are a few ways to do this:

You can gently push back with a polite explanation that their request won’t be possible to complete under the current constraints—the scope, time, and/or cost—of the project. 

You can politely offer to get back to the stakeholder with your response. This gives you time to better understand the request and to consult with trusted team members to lay out the benefits and costs of this request. And, if you are lucky, this might even give the stakeholder the opportunity to reconsider their request or forget about it entirely.

Whether you choose to push back immediately or get back to your stakeholder with your response, it is crucial to offer alternative solutions. Maybe the project timeline can expand to accommodate the request. Or maybe you and your team have a strong relationship with another team at the organization that can help fulfill  the request. Whatever the alternative, brainstorming other options can help soften the blow and provide stakeholders with new ideas.

For example, you consider telling your sponsor that the current project timeline will only allow for the launch of three new coffee flavors, and that the launch of a fourth flavor would only be possible by pushing the launch date back by two months. If you were to respond to your sponsor in this way, you would be both gently refusing their request and offering them an alternative that could work for your team.

While a simple “no” response might frustrate the person making the request, gentle pushback paired with alternative options can protect your team from new work while preserving your professional relationship with stakeholders. If your stakeholders trust your leadership abilities and perspective, then they will be more likely to accept your pushback and alternative solutions.

**Intervening from behind the scenes**
Another way project managers provide air cover for their teams is to master the challenge of  delicately intervening from behind the scenes when a stakeholder is making unrealistic requests or offering unreasonable critiques. 

Continuing with our coffee company example, you know how hard your team has been working to launch the new products. To avoid causing the extra stress that might come with the knowledge that the stakeholder wants to increase their workload, you avoid sharing this request with your entire project team.

This doesn’t mean you need to come up with a solution all by yourself, however. Instead of calling a team meeting to discuss the stakeholder’s request for a new flavor, you consult with only two trusted members of your team to help brainstorm solutions. One of these team members mentions that they know two new flavors are slated to be added to the fall product lineup in six months, and that perhaps the caramel flavor could be launched then instead of with the current group. This would give your team more time to work on developing the product while still fulfilling the stakeholder’s request. 

Ultimately, you bring the suggestions of adding the flavor to the fall product lineup or pushing back the launch date of the current lineup to the project sponsor, and they accept your solution to launch the new flavor in the fall.

Managing the expectations of your stakeholder while looping in relevant teammates on a need-to-know basis was essential here. This allowed your team to focus on their work without the possibility of an increased workload or an unnecessary distraction.

**Key takeaway**
Providing air cover for your team takes practice. It requires a careful balance of the needs of your stakeholders and the needs of your project team. As you become more experienced in leading projects, you will develop a stronger sense of how to manage nuanced situations like these and provide the air cover your team needs to do their best work.

### A framework for ethical decision-making
Ethical leadership is a form of leadership that promotes and values honesty, justice, respect, community, and integrity. As the leader of a project team, you will be expected to help your team succeed by leading with ethics. Building respect and trust with the teams you work with—from individuals to external partners to project stakeholders—begins with practicing ethical conduct. 

In this reading, you’ll gain an understanding of a common framework for ethical decision-making that can help you ensure your actions align with the ethical standards of your organization.

**Ethics within your organization**
Ethics can be defined as the principles of conduct governing an individual or a group. However, there is no single, universally-accepted grouping of ethical standards—these definitions differ based on the culture and community at your company. In the working world, ethical standards may differ based on profession, industry, and organization. Usually, an organization will have its own code of conduct which specifies the standards to which it holds its employees accountable. 

Here at Google, our code of conduct makes clear the expectations that we have for our employees and board members. It is possible that the organizations you will join throughout your career will have codes of conduct, too.  

Part of the challenge of leading with ethics is ensuring that your actions align with the ethical standards of your community, both within your organization and beyond it. In your role as a project manager, a clear framework for ethical decision-making can help guide you to make positive decisions throughout your project.

A common framework for ethical decision-making The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University
 developed the following framework as a helpful guide for ethical decision-making. https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/ 

Recognize an ethical issue, get the facts, evaluate alternative actions, make a decision and test it, act and reflect

**Recognize an ethical issue**

According to this framework, you can begin to question the ethics of an issue by asking yourself questions about the nature of the issue. Could your decision negatively impact another person or group of people? Does the issue go beyond what is legal or efficient? From there, you can proceed onto fact gathering.

**Example:** A vendor you have worked with in the past sends you a generous holiday gift shortly before you are about to select a vendor for a particular task in your project. If you accept the gift, would others be negatively impacted? To determine the answer to this question, get more facts.

**Get the facts**
Decide what you should do about the issue, and seek answers as needed. Consult with the right people to consider all of the options available to you.

**Example:** Continuing with the example above, you should check to see if your company has ethics guidelines regarding accepting gifts from external parties. If not, consult with your HR representative about the matter.

**Evaluate alternative actions**
You can evaluate alternative actions by asking yourself the following questions:

“Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?”

“Which option best respects the rights of all who have a stake?” 

“Which option treats people equally or proportionally?”

“Which option best serves the community as a whole, not just some members?”

“Which option leads me to act as the sort of person I want to be?”

Note that your answers to these questions are subjective, and you may want to elicit the opinion of others before deciding on an alternative action.

**Example:** In the case of the vendor gift example, the answer to the question “Which option treats people equally or proportionally?” might be “decline the gift,” given that accepting it might influence your decision about who to award the contract to.

**Make a decision and test it**
Once you have chosen an option, test it by imagining the reaction to your choice from a person whose opinion you value. 

**Example:** Once you have decided to decline the gift, discuss your decision with your manager, HR representative, or a trusted colleague.

**Act and reflect on the outcome**
Consider how to carry out your decision with thoughtfulness and care, and after you act, consider the results of your decision.

**Example:** Respectfully decline the vendor’s gift, noting your reason (for example, your company’s ethical guidelines state that employees are not permitted to accept gifts valued at more than $20 from vendors or contractors).

**Key takeaway**
A framework like this one can help you feel better-equipped to make ethical decisions regarding your project and team, which is a central component of ethical leadership.

Like so much of project management, ethical leadership takes diligence and practice, and it is crucial to build this skill. As you become more comfortable leading project teams, you will strengthen your ability to make decisions that you can feel good about. Gaining trust and respect from the people you work with can make it easier to influence without authority. If those around you trust your decision-making, they may be more likely to try to help you achieve project goals, even if you aren’t their direct manager.

### Creating an effective influencing statement
Introductions in literature are important. Think of the opening lines of a good book—they help set the tone for what the reader can expect going forward. Introductions are important in project management too, especially when you are hoping to influence a stakeholder to consider and approve a new plan or idea. 

In this reading, we will help you apply techniques you can use to influence others. We will take you through the steps of creating a strong influencing statement that opens the conversation and sets you up for success with your audience.

**What is influencing?**
First, let’s review what it means to influence another person. Influencing is the ability to alter another person’s thinking or behaviors. If you have ever tried to persuade another person to understand your point of view, then you know that influencing is easier said than done.

**Conger’s four steps**
In his article, The Necessary Art of Persuasion, Jay A. Conger identified four steps to effectively influence another person to consider new ideas. 

As you learned earlier, those steps are: 

**Establish credibility**

**Frame for common ground**

**Provide evidence**

**Connect emotionally**


Throughout your career in project management, there will be times when you will need to influence someone to consider an idea, approve a plan, or complete a project task. Conger’s four steps provide a useful framework for thoughtfully approaching conversations that are important to project success and influencing stakeholders. Let’s explore each step further before applying them to an influencing statement:

**1. Establish credibility**
When trying to persuade another person to listen to you, it helps to establish credibility. Ask yourself, why should this person listen to you? According to Conger, it is best to draw credibility from both expertise and relationships. 

You can build credibility by showing a level of expertise on the topic at hand. It also helps to have “a history of sound judgement.” If you find that you lack expertise on a subject, don’t worry! You can work to increase your knowledge through education or research, or you can even ask an expert for help.

You can also build credibility through strong relationships with your audience and others around you. Conger found that influential leaders tend to show their trustworthiness and willingness to do right by their colleagues over time, and in turn, people are more likely to listen to them.

**2. Frame for common ground**
The next step in effectively persuading people is to frame for common ground. You can do this by making a case for how your idea would benefit your audience, and you can determine how your ideas will benefit your audience by gaining a strong understanding of them and what they value. Pay close attention to what matters to your audience by listening carefully and gathering information during meetings and conversations. Then frame your ideas based on your audience’s needs and interests. 

**3. Provide evidence**
The third step is to provide evidence that supports your ideas. As Conger notes, though numbers are important, the best persuaders pair numbers with vivid language. They share stories, examples, and metaphors to help influence their audiences. Using vivid language can help bring your figures to life and draw stakeholders’ interest to your proposal.

**4. Connect emotionally**
The fourth step is to connect emotionally with your audience. In this step, you illustrate that you are emotionally invested in the idea that you are presenting. But crucially, Conger notes, you must also do your best to determine and match the emotional state of your audience.

Applying Conger’s steps to an influencing statement
Conger’s four steps—establish credibility, frame for common ground, provide evidence, and connect emotionally—are meant to be applied throughout important conversations with those whom you aim to influence. But to set yourself up for success during these conversations, you can apply the four steps to the influencing statement that sets the stage for your idea. 

Let’s discuss how Conger’s four steps come together in the following example: 

Carmen is a project manager at a small marketing agency. She would like to convince a human resources director at her organization to approve a new process for onboarding new graphic design employees.

Though the company has an existing onboarding process, this process is the same for all new hires, regardless of role. As a project manager working in the human resources department, she learns that it is hard for newly-hired graphic designers to onboard since there are only a few people who hold graphic design roles at the company. Carmen identifies that there is a lack of information available for new graphic design hires to turn to for learning about procedures and software specific to their role. 

Carmen would like to propose that all new graphic design hires receive a digital welcome packet containing guidelines for installing software, processes to be aware of, and other design-specific onboarding documents. Carmen developed a similar process in her role at a previous company, and it received a positive response from employees. She thinks a similar process will work for her new organization too, so she sets up time with her director to present her idea.

To influence her director to approve the new process, Carmen opens her presentation with a strong influencing statement:

I’d like to propose a new onboarding process for graphic design hires. 

(Provide evidence) In reviewing our new hire surveys, 80% of recent graphic design hires have assigned a negative rating to our onboarding process. When I followed up  with respondents, I learned that our graphic designers lack access to relevant information that could help them acclimate to our organization faster. To address this issue, I would like to create a digital welcome packet containing design-specific onboarding documentation.

(Frame for common ground) I have met with leaders on the graphic design team to discuss this idea, and they agreed that a design-specific onboarding process might help increase the productivity of new hires, since a better onboarding process would enable them to be better prepared to take on projects in their first few weeks on the job.

(Establish credibility) In my previous role, I designed a similar, role-specific onboarding process, which increased our new hire satisfaction rates by 60%. I think a new process could benefit employees here, as well.

(Connect emotionally) It can be overwhelming to join a new company. A smoother, more personalized onboarding experience might help set the tone for the kind of support new graphic design hires can expect from our team. 

**Key takeaway**
In this influencing statement, the project manager:

Provided evidence from company surveys to set the stage for her proposal.

Framed for common ground by noting how a new onboarding process might increase employee productivity.

Established credibility by outlining her previous experience with launching similar processes.

Connected emotionally by encouraging her audience to reflect on past experiences they may have endured as a new hire. 

By opening with a strong influencing statement, you can set yourself up for a successful conversation that is more likely to persuade your audience and achieve your goals.

Principles of effective email writing
Image of email icon
Email has long been the primary method of communication for many people in business, yet messages are easy to misunderstand or ignore. In this reading, we will discuss four principles of effective email writing that will help your emails to stand out, be remembered, and elicit the response you need. These principles are:

State what you want clearly.

Keep the content short and concise.

Structure your writing.

Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

### Principles of effective email writing

**State what you want clearly**

When you set out to compose an email, it is because there is something that you want from your reader. You might want to receive a simple answer, to persuade someone of something, or to arrange a meeting. Before composing an email, think about what you want, when you need what you want, and the best way to get what you want when you want it. 

Here are some tips on how to clearly state what you want in your email:

Include your request in the subject line of your email.

State your request within the first two paragraphs of your email message.

Indicate the specific call-to-action associated with your request (for example, reply, review, RSVP).

Write clear, concise sentences when providing details.

Define terms. Avoid using acronyms and terminology that users may not know. Provide additional information as necessary to avoid misunderstanding. 

**Keep the content concise**
Make your words work for you. Remove any writing that doesn’t help to define what you want or contribute to your reader's needs.

Summarize the content you want to convey, and remove anything in your email that doesn’t contribute to your goal.

Aim to write **“question-less”** and **“self-standing”** emails. This means that the message contains enough information to stand on its own. The reader shouldn’t have any questions about what you want and when you want it.

Know your audience. Some people—such as executives and other busy leadership—may not want to read emails of more than a few sentences or click on external links for further information. Try to tailor your emails accordingly.

**Structure your writing**
Structure has to do with the visual flow, or aesthetics, of your email. A well-structured email conveys critical information to the reader quickly and allows them to scan the explanatory text—or ignore it altogether. Here are some tips for effectively structuring your email:

**Use bullets**. Bullets break up the visual flow. If you have more than one of something, consider using bullets. Write strong action verbs at the start of each bullet.

**Use labels**. Labels help guide the reader to what information is most important. 

**Add hyperlinks**. Hyperlinks allow readers to directly access additional information, rather than adding lengthy details to your email.

**Write a strong topic sentence**. Place the main idea of the paragraph in the topic sentence. 

**Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling**
Grammar, punctuation, and spelling are critical. Turning grammar and spelling suggestions on in your email application can help you quickly identify errors. Be sure to correct any errors before sending off. 

**Applying effective email writing principles**
In order to learn how to apply these principles, let’s check out the following example email:

Issac was given the task of sending an email about the company’s annual team building retreat. Please note: Blue, underlined text indicates a hyperlink to an external site or document.

Example Example 1. See detailed description:Subject : Annual Team Building Retreat - Register Now!
Team,
I am thrilled to invite you all officially to the 2021 Annual Team Building Retret. As in previous years, we are taking time out to celebrate and strengthen our team spirit—to learn from each other and to plan for the challenges ahead.
Weve got something special planned for this retreat! Beyond the staples of world-class training, fabulous working sessions, and executive presentations, we've also arranged:
An Annual Awards Dinner at the Hotel San Francisco; pre-booked rooms for those who want to stay at the hotel after dinner; and an afternoon at Shoreline Lake with sailing, rowing, and paddle boats available.
We hope you can join us for all three excursons. Don't forget to register and sign up per the instructions on the site.
Our theme this year is Transform. We look forward to sharing a transformational week with you all!
Best,
Issac Soto


This email example is not as effective as it could be. The date and location of the event are not included. The main link Issac wants the reader to click—to register for the event—is buried at the bottom of the email. The other links in the message are also overwhelming because there are so many. There are no bullets or labels to help organize the information. Additionally, there are a few spelling and punctuation errors. 

Let’s examine how Issac’s email could be revised to be more effective.

Email Example 2. See detailed description for full text:Subject: Annual Team Building Retreat - Register Now!
Team,
I am thrilled to invite you to the 2021 Annual Team Building Retreat, October 13–15 at the Hotel San Francisco. This is an opportunity to celebrate and strengthen our team spirit and to learn from one another as we plan for the challenges ahead. To end the event, we will hold our Annual Awards Dinner.
Sign up now! 
-For the retreat
-For hotel rooms
-For lakeside activities
Best,
Issac Soto


In this example, there is a clear, concise description of what the email is about at the very beginning of the email. The dates and location of the event are clearly stated at the beginning of the email. The opening paragraph is directly followed by a label in bold: Sign up now! Then, bullet points help set apart the hyperlinks for better visibility, and the hyperlinks clearly state what the reader will access when they click. Lastly, the grammar, spelling, and punctuation are all accurate.

**Key takeaway**
When you write an email, think about the people you are sending it to and what they need in order to quickly read and correctly understand it. Remember to:

-State what you want clearly.

-Keep the content concise.

-Structure your writing.

-Check grammar, punctuation, and spelling.

Keeping these principles in mind when you draft emails will help you communicate more effectively with your team members, stakeholders, customers, and others. It can also demonstrate your level of professionalism and competence and inspire others’ confidence in your abilities.

### Facilitating inclusive and accessible meetings
In the previous video, we discussed how to organize an effective meeting. Recall that effective meetings generally have four elements in common: they are structured, intentional, collaborative, and inclusive. In this reading, you will explore the fourth element: how to make your meetings more inclusive. 

**Creating an inclusive environment**
Inclusion of employees from different backgrounds and identities is extremely important for any organization looking to build a strong sense of connection in the workplace. Also, when team members feel included, they tend to want to do their best work. This is great for the organization, too. Creating an inclusive environment can be particularly challenging in meetings because they can be intimidating for participants. As a project manager, it is part of your job to facilitate meetings that are inclusive of all participants and that create a sense of emotional safety and value for everyone’s active input. In order to help facilitate inclusive meetings that feel empowering to everyone, you should put procedures in place that are consistently followed and predictable. 

Formalize initial check-ins for the group that build understanding and ensure everyone knows their input is needed. Create a process that consistently asks each person for an update on their work and/or how they are doing in their daily lives. Questions should be open-ended and vary over time to include some humor, analogies, and “finish the sentence” opportunities. As the project manager, your modeling will set the tone for the team dynamic, so always check-in with your team and model professionalism, vulnerability, and empathy. Popular check-ins include: “A highlight of my week has been . . .” and “This week I have gratitude for . . .” 

Give everyone your full attention. Listen carefully to what everyone has to say and be careful not to interrupt someone who is speaking. Body language—such as maintaining eye contact and turning your body in the direction of a speaker—can help someone feel safe in voicing their opinion. Avoid head shaking, looking away, or looking at your phone when someone is speaking.

Help all participants to be heard. Solicit ideas from participants, and ask questions to encourage participation. If someone gets interrupted, redirect everyone’s attention to that person and prompt them to finish their thought. If someone has not spoken yet, ask them what they think. It is important to note that, for some people, speaking up in meetings can be daunting. This can be especially true in virtual meetings or conference calls. This is also true for people who are not the majority in the room and may feel like they are representing an entire group of people who look, sound, or present like them. You may also find that people who are entry-level may be nervous about speaking up too since they are just beginning their careers. You can help people feel more comfortable and supported by letting them know ahead of time that they will be asked to share during a meeting so that they can prepare in advance. You can also solicit input after a meeting from anyone who did not speak.

Help participants feel comfortable sharing different perspectives. Encourage differing or opposing ideas by making clear that alternate viewpoints are valued. To set the tone for this, start the meeting by encouraging competing perspectives. Try to get at least three points of view on an issue that might have some variation in the room. Follow up after the meeting with a request for additional thoughts. 

Use images that reflect the diversity of the world. In your presentation materials and handouts, select images that illustrate diversity in race, gender, age, ability, cultural background, religion, geographical location, and so on. The people in your images should represent diverse backgrounds to further support inclusion, allowing everyone in the room to feel welcome and represented.

**Making meetings accessible to everyone**
Meetings can’t be inclusive if not everyone can fully participate. It is important to make sure that your meetings are accessible to everyone. Accessible means that something is easily used, accessed, or adapted for use by people experiencing disabilities. In meetings, this means that people experiencing disabilities are not excluded from participating or understanding the information shared. 

When planning your meetings, you should consider the needs of people experiencing the following types of disabilities:

Visual impairments and blindness

Hearing loss and deafness

Mobility disabilities, which means having difficulty getting around, such as people who require wheelchairs or canes

Neurological disorders

These tips can help you ensure that the following participants have full access to your meetings:

**People with visual impairments**
Presentation materials
-Use a large font size (minimum 22 points).

-Use high-contrast colors.

-Provide alternative text descriptions for all images, pictures, graphics, tables, and so on.

-Provide low-vision or blind attendees with an accessible electronic format of the presentation.

-Provide presentation materials in an accessible electronic format to participants ahead of time.

-Describe all meaningful graphics in your presentation (such as photos, images, charts, and illustrations).

**Handouts and printed materials**
-Use a large font size (minimum 18 points).

-Use black lettering on white, matte paper.

-Use a simple font and avoid compressed fonts and italics.

-Use 1.25 to double spacing between lines.

**People who are deaf or hard of hearing**
Always face the person you are communicating with. This is especially helpful for audience members who are speech readers.

Speak clearly, at a moderate pace and volume, and allow the other person time to respond. Avoid exaggerating, slowing your speech, or speaking loudly.

Ask for clarification if you don’t understand something the person is communicating.

Include all of the information presented in a spoken presentation on slides.

Add closed captions or subtitles to videos. 
YouTube Help
 provides instructions for adding your own closed captions to your videos. 

**People with mobility impairments**
Provide ample circulation space in your meeting room so that people using mobility devices can easily pass through. 

Offer accessible seating locations throughout the room. 

For presentations, use half-round seating so that all participants may face in the direction of the speaker. 

**People with neurological disorders**
Provide an agenda or task list to allow time for participants to understand content and expectations

Make sure any video call platform you use allows closed captioning

Be sure to record the meeting, and provide easy access to the recording to all meeting participants

For handouts or presentations, use simple page layouts that are easy to understand and use.

For resource materials, break up passages of text with images, graphs, or illustrations to highlight the context

Avoid using presentations with moving or flickering content, or background audio that cannot be turned off

**Key takeaway**
Creating meetings that are inclusive and accessible to all participants will improve your team’s engagement, productivity, and morale.

### Checklist for productive meetings
A woman studying a checklist on her computer
You may have attended a few meetings that you did not think were the best use of your time. Frequent and unproductive meetings tend to have a negative impact on individual and team productivity and well-being. In this reading, you will learn best practices for ensuring productivity before, during and after meetings.

Plenty of things can make meetings unproductive, but an internal study at Google revealed that productive meetings have three elements in common:

Active participation from attendees

A clear and concise agenda that is followed throughout

The correct attendees (meaning the participants can contribute to achieving the meeting’s goal)

Follow this checklist to help achieve these aims and facilitate more productive meetings for you and your project team:

**Before the meeting**
Prepare an agenda that states the purpose and goals of the meeting, and share the agenda with participants.

Only invite people who need to be there and who can help reach the goals of the meeting. Make participants’ roles and responsibilities for the meeting clear. Add non-essential participants as optional to the meeting invitation.

If you are working with people in different time zones, share the time zone burden by alternating recurring meeting times.

Evaluate the need for the meeting and cancel if it isn’t necessary. Consider whether the meeting content can be covered via email. 

Schedule shorter meetings. Meetings tend to expand to the time allotted to them, so try to get more done in a shorter amount of time.

Set aside time to prepare for the meeting. Read the necessary materials, review the agenda, and come ready to participate. 

**During the meeting**
At the beginning of the meeting, clearly state the meeting goals. Stick to the agenda throughout the meeting to avoid getting derailed. For recurring meetings, review the action items from the previous meeting to ensure accountability. 

Encourage participants to put phones and laptops away during meetings and silence notifications, if possible.

Practice and demonstrate active listening. Respond verbally (e.g., “That makes sense. Tell us more.”) and non-verbally (through head nodding and eye contact) to show engagement.  

Encourage participation and give everyone a chance to speak, including remote participants. Ask open-ended questions like, “What does everyone think?” instead of “Does everyone agree?”

Help everyone relax and feel more comfortable by starting meetings with open-ended, personal questions like, “How was your weekend?”

Capture key points, action items, and decisions from the meeting, and assign action items to the appropriate meeting participants.

**After the meeting**
Recap key decisions, action items, timelines, and notes and send out to participants.

Schedule necessary follow-up meetings with relevant context.

Assess the need for and frequency of recurring meetings. Schedule meetings less frequently, if possible.

**Pro Tip:** If you are new to the company or team, find out about and try to apply their typical meeting practices before making any major changes.

**Key takeaway**
Productive meetings generally require active participation from attendees, a clear and concise agenda that is followed throughout, and the correct attendees. Following the best practices for before, during, and after meetings described here can help you have more productive meetings. When less time is needed for meetings because meetings are more productive, more time can be devoted to project tasks.

Project closing:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e66c7e7-a1cc-4e01-8228-9cf33ae40fc1)

Projenin kapatılması için tüm işlerin bitmiş olması gerekir. Bunun için projeyi 2-3 kere gözden geçirip sorun var mı yok mu kontrol etmek şarttır.

Proje yönetim çalışmaları tamamlandı mı bunlara bakılır? Gerekli imzalar atıldı mı?

Diğer aşamada proje paydaşlarının projenin bittiğinin bilgisinin verilmesidir.

Projeyi kapatmanın amacı çatlaklardan bir şeylerin kaçmamasını sağlamak.Güvenilirliliği bozmamak.

Bu da iki şeye neden olur ya hiç bitmeyen proje ve terk edilen proje.

### Case study: The impact of skipping project closure steps
In the video, we discussed the importance of the last phase of the project life cycle: closing the project. You learned that, in order to close a project, you must ensure that:

All work is done.

All agreed-upon project management processes have been executed.

You have received formal recognition and agreement from key stakeholders that the project is done.

In this reading, we will discuss the impact of skipping important project closure steps. 

Sometimes project closure is improperly conducted or never happens at all. This can have a major impact on your organization’s overall profitability and success. Skipping the closure phase can compromise a project that had otherwise been running smoothly. No matter how successful the project may look in its final stages, your job as a project manager is not complete until all steps of the closure phase have been completed.

**Case study: Tilly’s Toys**
In order to better understand what can happen when a project is not properly closed out, let’s examine a possible scenario: Tilly’s Toys, a small children’s toy manufacturer, developed a new interactive piggy bank that speaks and plays songs to help children learn number recognition, counting, and adding. Below are several oversights that occurred as a result of not properly closing out the project.

**Oversight #1: Not all of the work was completed.**
**What happened:** When Tilly’s Toys received the final toy box from the packager, they realized that it did not include the safety disclaimer that the toy includes small parts and should not be used by children under the age of three. The design of this disclaimer had been included in the original Statement of Work but was never completed. 

**Impact on the organization:** When the missing disclaimer was discovered, Tilly’s Toys was not able to use any of the boxes that had been created. They incurred significant costs to have the packager create all new boxes including the disclaimer. Having to recreate the boxes also meant that they were not able to meet their original launch date, which would have had the toys in stores before the holiday season. This oversight cost the organization additional revenue and extended the project timeline and resources.

**Oversight #2:** The organization did not complete an important agreed upon project management process. 
**What happened:** Tilly’s Toys customer, a regional chain of toy stores, required that all contractors working on the project sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). The NDA stated that the contractors would not disclose any information about the toy until its launch date. One of the educational experts contracted to review the toy was never given this NDA. Not having received—or signed—this important form, the contractor posted about the new toy on social media months before the toy’s launch date.

**Impact on the organization:** Sharing information with the public before the toy was launched was a breach of contract between Tilly’s Toys and their customer. This breach put Tilly’s Toys at significant legal risk.

**Oversight #3:** Stakeholders and the project manager did not provide formal recognition and agreement that the project was done.
**What happened:** Ames, the project manager, communicated with the customer throughout the toy’s development about their objectives for the toy. After the previous oversights were rectified and Ames assumed his team was done with the project, he released the team to work on other projects. Shortly after, the customer sent a list of additional changes they wanted to see in the toy’s design.

**Impact on the organization:** Ames had to tell the customer that it was too late to implement their design requests. The customer was unhappy and told Ames that they may consider using a different toy manufacturer in the future.

**Avoiding the impact of project closure oversights**
 Oversights or skipping steps in the closing phase of a project can:

-Impact the product’s or service’s scheduled launch dates.

-Put your organization at legal risk.

-Result in significant financial losses to your organization.

-Undermine your team's credibility, and yours.

-Damage your relationship with the customer or client.

All of the steps of the project life cycle—initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project—are essential for a successful outcome. Unfortunately, closing the project is a phase that too often gets skipped, which can negatively impact both the project manager and their organization. To avoid these issues, make sure to plan for this phase just as you would any of the other project life cycle phases.

### Demonstrating project impact to stakeholders
Previously, you learned why completing the closing phase of the project life cycle is important. As we discussed, a formal closing process is essential because improper closing may leave you at risk for incomplete contracts and scope. It is also important to make sure that all stakeholders feel like their needs are met and to review areas for improvements in the future.

In this reading, we will further discuss how to demonstrate the impact of your project to your stakeholders through impact reporting. Impact reporting is a presentation or formal report prepared for key stakeholders at the end of a project. 

**Highlight key performance areas**
The purpose of your impact report is to show your key stakeholders the impact your project had on the organization. Goals, objectives, budget, schedules, and key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be determined at the beginning of your project. Your impact report should demonstrate how well you did against those early targets. In your report, you should also answer the question: What was the problem we were trying to solve, and how did we solve it? This will help you showcase the value your project outcome brought to the business.

Highlight these key performance areas to demonstrate to your stakeholders how you achieved successful results and outcomes:

First, describe the goals and objectives you set for the project and what you hoped to have achieved by the end. 

Then, describe how you met those objectives against your KPIs. A KPI is a measurable value that demonstrates how effective a company is at achieving their objectives. In your impact report, review how you defined the success of your project at the beginning, and highlight the outcomes you achieved that demonstrate this success.

Finally, showcase your schedule and budget performance by outlining your cost savings and efficiencies. Demonstrate that you met the deadlines set in your project scope and that your project was completed within budget.

**Use metrics to showcase your results**
Use facts and statistics to highlight the results you achieved related to the performance areas described in the section above. Examples of common metrics you might include to demonstrate a positive impact could include: 

**Improvement in schedule performance**

-Revenue growth

-Positive return on investment (ROI)

-Increased external user counts

-Increased percentage of internal users 

-Cost vs. margins

-High percentage of customer satisfaction 

-Reduction in overhead

-Reduction in technical issues

-Time saved

Metrics and data points are one of the best ways to present impact. Throughout your project, collect data and track progress in each of the areas you want to measure. If you can complement your metrics with the appropriate visuals and tie them back to the project’s larger goals, you can quickly demonstrate your project’s success and value.

**Prepare an effective impact report presentation**
An effective presentation can help your stakeholders understand your project’s impact. In order to successfully convey all of the information you have prepared: 

**Be concise.**
While you should share metrics that illustrate how you achieved your project goals, you do not need to include extraneous details. For clarity, organize information by using bullet points instead of paragraphs. 

**Understand your audience.** 
Make sure that your report does not use too much technical language or jargon to help your stakeholders understand it.

**Use visuals.** 
Use a digital presentation application, such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, or Canva to present your impact report. Add diagrams, such as charts and graphs, to illustrate your results. Use images to add visual interest. Add icons to draw attention to information and help your stakeholders quickly understand information.

**Describe your learnings.**
Discuss lessons you learned during the course of the project and any areas you have identified for improvement.

**Keep your stakeholders engaged.** 
Grab and keep your stakeholders’ attention by varying the way that you present your data:

Show: Play videos of demos, testimonials, or case studies.

Storytell: Tell a story or anecdote related to the data in the report. 

Engage: Ask for audience participation through questions, surveys, or quizzes.

**Key takeaways**
As a project manager, impact reporting is a great opportunity to demonstrate the impact of your project and the value you bring to your organization. By highlighting key performance areas, using metrics to showcase results, and preparing an effective presentation, you can impress your stakeholders and convince them of your project’s success.
