When to use: Suitable for projects where finishing on time is critical and detailed task tracking is needed.

Purpose: To measure the amount of work done versus the amount of work remaining over time.

### Choose the right tracking method for your project

So far, you've learned about the importance of tracking project progress. You’ve also reviewed some of the different tracking methods used by project managers, like project plans, Gantt and Burndown charts, and Roadmaps. This reading will explore and compare these popular tracking methods in more detail so you can feel more confident choosing the best method for your projects.

**Gantt charts**
The Gantt chart is one of the most popular tracking methods and can be used for all types of projects. Gantt charts typically live in your project plan and are updated as the project progresses.

Gantt charts are useful for:

Helping a team stay on schedule

Projects with lots of tasks, dependencies, and milestones

Projects with large teams, because ownership and responsibilities are explicitly laid out visually

Asana, one of the work management software tools featured in this certification, has useful resources for getting started with Gantt charts. Practice working with Gantt charts on your own with a 



**Roadmaps**
Roadmaps are another common tracking method. Like Gantt charts, Roadmaps also track both individual and project progress toward milestones. However, Roadmaps are best suited for tracking big milestones in your project. 

Roadmaps are useful for:

High-level tracking of large milestones. Roadmaps outline the project as a whole and provide an overall snapshot of key points—just like an actual roadmap contains points of interest and mile markers. 

Illustrating to your team or key stakeholders how a project should evolve over time

**Burndown charts**
Burndown charts are typically used by Agile Scrum teams. Burndown charts reveal how quickly your team is working by displaying how much work is left and how much time remains to complete the work. The main uses of a Burndown chart are to keep the project team on top of targeted completion dates and make them aware of scope creep if it occurs. The chart should be displayed so everyone can see it and needs to be updated regularly in order to be effective.

Burndown charts are useful for:

Projects that require a detailed review of tasks

Projects where finishing on time is the top priority

### Project status reports
In this lesson, you are learning to identify and compare various types of tracking methods. This reading will cover project status reports and how you can use them to track and communicate common project elements in a snapshot.

Key components of a project status report
A project status report gives an overview of all of the project’s common elements and summarizes them in a snapshot. It is an efficient communication tool to convey the latest status in one place for the team and stakeholders.

**Most status reports contain the following components:**

Project name: The project name should be specific to the purpose of the project so that the overall goal of the project can be understood at-a-glance. 

Date: You will create project status reports many times during the course of a project’s implementation phase. Reports can be created weekly or monthly—it all depends on the stakeholders’ needs and pace of the project. Adding the date to each status report acts as a reference point for your audience and also creates a history log of the project’s status over time. 

Summary: The summary condenses the project’s goals, schedule, highlights, and lowlights in one central place for easy stakeholder visibility. Usually, the summary section will be followed by, or grouped with, the timeline summary and the overall project status.

**Status:** As you can imagine, status is a crucial piece. The status of the project illustrates your actual progress versus your planned progress. In project management, a common way to depict this is through RAG (red, amber, green), or Red-Yellow-Green, status reporting. RAG follows a traffic light pattern to indicate progress and status. Red indicates that there are issues that need resolution and that the project may be delayed or go significantly over budget. Amber/Yellow means that there are potential issues with schedule or budget, but that the issues can likely be resolved with corrective actions. And green means the schedule and budget are doing fine and that the project is on track. You can use RAG to indicate the overall project status, as well as milestone status. Every project team and stakeholder may have a slightly different perspective on what the colors mean and how urgent it is to escalate issues when they see an amber/yellow or red status, so it’s important to make sure everyone understands what the different color statuses mean for your project.

**Milestones and tasks:** A summary of the project’s major milestones thus far and current tasks helps the team and stakeholders easily visualize the progress of those elements. In a project plan, you will typically depict the tasks and milestones as ‘not started,’ ‘in progress’ or ‘completed’ at an item-by-item level. But, in the project status report, it is common to summarize these items into two categories to better communicate the status. You’ll use key accomplishments to detail what has happened, and upcoming to detail what big milestones you will accomplish next.

Issues: The issues include your project's current roadblocks and potential risks. Status reports are an important opportunity to set expectations with your stakeholders. If your project status is red or amber, you can flag what is preventing you from being where you planned to be. You can also use this opportunity to state your plan to get the project back to green, and ask for any resources or help you may need to do so. You will learn more about communicating big risks and issues in the upcoming videos.

**Project status report types**
With those key elements in mind, you can format your report in a variety of ways depending on your audience and what you need to communicate. 

If you need to share a status report with your team for a project that contains multiple layers of complexity, it may be best to format the report in a spreadsheet in order to keep track of all the moving parts. 

If you simply need to communicate updates to senior stakeholders, your status report may be best formatted as a slideshow, like the one below, containing only an overview of the most key points.

Example of a project status report snapshot with name, summary, status, issues, pending items and milestones and tasks
**Key takeaways**
To recap, project status reports are a powerful tool to:

Improve and simplify communication across the team.

Keep everyone, including key stakeholders, informed.

Request more resources and support (if needed).

Create structure and transparency by recording the project status in a centralized place.

### Case study: Using risk management tools

Thus far, you have learned that risk management—the process of identifying, evaluating, and addressing potential risks and issues that could impact a project—is a core part of a project manager's role. You also learned about techniques to identify potential risks and address their effects, including creating risk registers and building mitigation plans. In the following case study, we will imagine how a project manager might utilize these tools.

The project: Paw Snacks Puppy Treats
Paw Snacks is an online retailer of tasty and nutritious pet treats. Over the course of three years, the business has grown from a small startup to a 350-person organization. Paw Snacks wants to expand its offerings even further by adding a new line of treats for puppies. 

**Image of Paw Snacks dog treat**
The issue
Six weeks before the new product line is scheduled to debut, Naja, the project manager leading the launch, receives a frantic phone call from a manager at the commercial bakery hired to produce the treats. The bakery manager informs Naja that the bone-shaped cookie cutters required to shape the treats have not yet arrived. Naja knows that baking needs to start the following day in order to stay on schedule for the launch. 

Naja thanks the bakery manager for the warning and asks her teammate, Abe, to call the cookie cutter manufacturer to check on the status of their order. Abe learns that the order is delayed due to a product shortage and that the cookie cutters are now expected to arrive at the bakery two days after the original expected delivery date.

Naja recognizes that this delay threatens her team’s ability to launch their product on time. Even worse, her team doesn’t have the option to push the launch date, since the Paw Snacks marketing team has already purchased nonrefundable advertising placements for the day of the launch. Luckily, Naja and her team are already prepared for an issue like this one. 

**Planning for risks ahead of time**
Months earlier, long before the team started work on the project, Naja and her team brainstormed potential risks that could impact the project. They created a risk register, a table or chart that contains a list of risks and is often paired with a probability and impact matrix. During the process, the team determined that a delay in the cookie cutter order had a medium probability of occurring and would result in a high impact on the project. Naja added the risk to the risk register and assigned Abe to create a mitigation plan, which outlines steps to decrease the chances of a risk occurring or decrease the impact of a risk if it does occur. This plan would indicate how the team would handle an issue if it were to materialize. The mitigation plan was then approved by the project sponsor and other stakeholders.

**Managing the issue**
Now that the cookie cutter issue has occurred, Naja and Abe consult the mitigation plan for this particular risk. In this case, Abe identified two options for handling the risk: The first option is to work with the bakery to slightly increase the number of treats produced in order to make up for the two days they have lost due to the cookie cutter delay. The second option is to place an order with a second bakery to help speed up the pace of production. Naja and Abe discuss the two plans and settle on option one to avoid the work of bringing in a second bakery.

Before moving ahead with the plan, Naja and Abe meet to brainstorm potential risks associated with the new plan. Together, they determine that a smaller order of dog treats will likely have a minor—but manageable—impact on the organization’s projected growth for 2021. They determine that the best course of action is to accept the risk to avoid delaying the project further. To ensure that the project stakeholders are aware of and comfortable with this change, Naja requests a meeting with her project sponsor to communicate the plan, outline the minor risk to projected growth, and recommend accepting the risk. The sponsor agrees and approves Naja’s new plan.

Naja tasks Abe with communicating the adjusted plan to the bakery manager. Though baking begins two days behind schedule, Naja’s new plan helps ensure that the team is prepared to launch the new line on time. 

**Pro tip:** While the term mitigation plan is used more often in project management, you may also hear the term contingency plan. These terms are often used interchangeably, but there are some key differences. A mitigation plan is a planned risk response strategy. If a project manager is able to identify the potential known risks that impact any of the key project parameters (schedule, cost, or scope), they should make a plan to mitigate those risks early in the project. A contingency plan, on the other hand, is mostly related to funds the project manager keeps aside (outside of the planned project budget ) to support any of these known risk response plans if they go beyond the planned amount or to manage any unforeseen risks during execution.

**Key takeaway**
In this case study, early risk management planning enabled Naja to act quickly when an issue presented itself at a pivotal time during the project execution phase. 

By consulting an existing mitigation plan and weighing two options for moving forward, Naja and Abe were able to make an informed decision about the best path forward. Naja also communicated the growth-related risks associated with the plan to the project sponsor in a timely fashion.

As you manage projects of your own, issues will come up again and again. When you do the heavy lifting of risk management planning before starting work on the project, you will be better equipped to respond to problems quickly.

**Assessment of Exemplar**

Compare the exemplar to your completed ROAM analysis. Review your work using each of the criteria in the exemplar. What did you do well? Where can you improve? Use your answers to these questions to guide you as you continue to progress through the course. 

Let’s review each issue in the ROAM analysis: 

**Issue 1:** In response to the potting issue, you contacted the warehouse to evaluate and improve the potting process. After two weeks with no additional problems, you consider the matter resolved. 

**Issue 2:** Your team handled the customer complaints by listening to their issues and offering to send them free plants. Most of the customers were satisfied with this solution. This issue is mitigated because you reduced its impact. 

**Issue 3:** You assign your IT Specialist to fix the issue with the customer service software. This issue is owned because the IT Specialist has not yet taken action, but there is a plan in place to take care of the issue.

**Issue 4:** Some customers have called to cancel their subscriptions. Your team offered them subscription promotions, but cannot get them to reconsider. Since a few cancellations will not have a major impact, you consider this issue accepted.

**Issue 5:** To solve the delivery driver problem, you ask the HR Specialist to schedule a hiring day to hire and onboard more drivers. This issue is owned by the HR Specialist because they have not yet hired the drivers.

**Issue 6:** Your team reassessed delivery routes, which increased efficiency and reduced the number of late deliveries. This risk is mitigated because you have lessened its impact.

**Issue 7:** Your Financial Analyst reassessed spending and found more money to offset the unexpected costs, so the issue is resolved.

## Communication Issues to Stakeholders

Sorunları çözme yöntemlerinden biri de Escalation dır. Yani kendinden daha kıdemli birinden rica etmektir.

### Writing an effective escalation email
In this lesson, you are learning how to communicate risks and changes to your team and stakeholders. In the previous video, you were introduced to escalation: the process of enlisting the help of higher level project leadership or management to remove an obstacle, clarify or reinforce priorities, and validate next steps.

There are many ways to escalate a risk, and it is important to set escalation standards with your stakeholders before beginning work on a project. In this reading, we will focus on the escalation email, and go over best practices for writing one.

**Escalation email best practices**
All projects—even those managed by experienced project managers—occasionally have problems. Your role as the project manager is to help resolve problems and remove barriers that prevent your team from making progress toward your goals. While many problems might be small enough to resolve within your core team, other problems—like a major change in your budget or timeline—may need to be brought to stakeholders for a final decision. Detailing these problems, their potential impact, and the support you need in a clear and direct email to your audience can be an effective communication tool.

Effective escalation emails:

Maintain a friendly tone

State your connection to the project

Explain the problem

Explain the consequences

Make a request

Let’s discuss these five keys to writing a strong escalation email.

**Maintain a friendly tone**
When drafting an escalation email, you may feel tempted to get straight to the point, especially when dealing with a stressful and time-sensitive problem. But keep in mind that it is important to address issues with grace. Consider opening your email with a simple show of goodwill, such as “I hope you’re doing well.” When describing the issue, aim for a blameless tone. Above all, keep the email friendly and professional. After all, you are asking for the recipient’s help. Be sure to close your email by thanking the recipient for their time.

**State your connection to the project**
Introduce yourself early in the email if you have less familiarity with the project stakeholders. Be sure to clearly state your name, role, and relationship to the project. This helps the reader understand why you are reaching out. Keep your introduction brief and to the point—a single sentence should suffice. If you know the person on the receiving end of the escalation email, you can simply reinforce your responsibility on the project before getting straight to the problem.

**Explain the problem**
Once you greet your recipient and briefly introduce yourself, explain the issue at hand. Clearly state the problem you need to solve. Provide enough context for the reader to understand the issue, but aim to keep your message as concise as possible. Avoid long, dense paragraphs that may obscure your message and tempt the reader to skim.

**Explain the consequences**
After explaining the problem, clearly outline the consequences. Describe specifically how this issue is negatively impacting the project or how it has the potential to negatively impact the project later in the project timeline. Again, keep your explanation concise and your tone friendly.

**Propose a course of action and make a request**
This is the central piece of a strong escalation email. In this section, you propose a solution (or solutions) and state what you need from the recipient. A thoughtful solution accompanied by a clear request lets the recipient know how they can help and moves you toward a resolution.

**Putting it all together**
Let’s see how these best practices come together to form a strong escalation email. In the scenario that prompts the email, Sayid, a project manager from a company that sells gift baskets, is having a quality control issue with one of the items in a line of holiday baskets. If the issue is not rectified soon, the product launch will have to be delayed and the company will lose money. In the annotated email example below, Sayid explains the issue to his internal stakeholders and requests a meeting with them.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e937342-fc35-4952-91ec-986da71bccd6)


Alternate text of email:

To: knelson@graciousgiftbaskets.com, gabrielmendoza@graciousgiftbaskets.com [Your stakeholders]

Subject: [Action required]  Decision needed to make progress on Holiday Scents project

Hi Karen and Gabriel,

[Keep it friendly and state your connection to the project]
I hope you are doing well. As you may know, I have been managing our Holiday Scents product line, which is scheduled to launch in October. 

[Explain the problem]
I would like to bring an issue to your attention. The baskets in this product line will include scented candles, and we placed an order with Candlemakers, Inc. for 5,000 candles to be delivered to the warehouse by Friday to prepare for our first customer shipment. To date, we have received 3,000 of the 5,000 candles. Unfortunately, many of the candles we have received so far fail to meet our quality standards. The packaging is damaged, or the candles themselves are broken. 

[Explain the consequences]
This puts our customer satisfaction rates at risk. Failure to meet the quality requirements for the candles by Friday will result in postponing the product launch by three weeks. If this delay occurs, we will incur an additional cost of $20,000 because we will need to order a new shipment of candles and review the quality standards of each to ensure that they meet our contractual agreements. 

[Propose a course of action and make a request]
I have sourced two backup suppliers that have five-star reviews and a track record of on-time deliveries. I propose we meet with them both right away so we can onboard one of them quickly. That way, we can avoid major delays. Are you available for a meeting tomorrow to discuss options and come to an agreement on next steps? Please respond with the times that work best for you. 

Thank you in advance for your consideration and insight,

Sayid

 End of email

**Key takeaway**
In this example, Sayid maintains a friendly tone, clearly explains the problem and its potential consequences, and makes a clear request of the recipients. The email is also brief and to the point. 

To recap, effective escalation emails apply these five best practices:

Maintain a friendly tone

State your connection to the project

Explain the problem

Explain the consequences

Make a request

Escalation is a useful skill for solving problems quickly, and sending a strong escalation email that applies these best practices can help get your team the help it needs.

### Recap: Quality management concepts
You are learning to define quality in your projects. Quality is when the outlined requirements for the deliverable are fulfilled and meet or exceed the needs and expectations of customers.

In this reading, we’ll review the four main concepts of quality management we discussed in the previous video: quality standards, quality planning, quality assurance, and quality control.

**Quality standards** provide requirements, specifications, or guidelines that can be used to ensure that products, processes, or services are fit for achieving the desired outcome. These standards must be met in order for the product, process, or service to be considered successful by the organization and the customer. You will set quality standards with your team and your customer at the beginning of your project. Well-defined standards lead to less rework and schedule delays throughout your project.

**Quality planning** involves the actions of you or your team to establish and conduct a process for identifying and determining exactly which standards of quality are relevant to the project as a whole and how to satisfy them. During this process, you'll plan the procedures to achieve the quality standards for your project.

**Quality assurance**, or QA, is a review process that evaluates whether the project is moving toward delivering a high-quality service or product. It includes regular audits to confirm that everything is going to plan and that the necessary procedures are being followed. Quality assurance helps you make sure that you and your customers are getting the exact product you contracted for.											

**Quality control**, or QC, involves monitoring project results and delivery to determine if they are meeting desired results. It includes the techniques that are used to ensure quality standards are maintained when a problem is identified. Quality control is a subset of quality assurance activities. While QA seeks to prevent defects before they occur, QC aims to identify defects after they have happened and also entails taking corrective action to resolve these issues.

### User acceptance testing: Goals, best practices, and management
In a previous video, you learned about different ways to measure customer satisfaction, including feedback surveys and user acceptance testing (UAT). This reading will focus on why conducting UAT is essential to the successful launch of any product, service, or software. We will also discuss some best practices for effective UAT and how to manage the feedback you receive. 

**The goals of UAT**
To recap, UAT is testing that helps a business make sure that a product, service, or process works for its users. The main objectives of UAT are to:

**Demonstrate that the product**, service, or process is behaving in expected ways in real-world scenarios. 

**Show that the product**, service, or process is working as intended.

**Identify issues that need to be addressed before project completion.**

UAT simulates real-world conditions, so when the feature works as intended during the testing process, you can be more confident that your product, service, or process will work properly once it is launched. It allows a project team to gather detailed information about how users interact with a product, service, or process. UAT helps the team answer such questions as: Do users recognize its purpose and uses? How do they interact with it? How much time do users take to interact with it? Do they notice all of its features? Is the product, service, or process accessible to everyone? UAT also allows the project team to record information about how users feel about their experience with a product, service, or process. Through testing, the team can learn about the emotions it evokes, identities it conveys, appeal it holds, and so on.

**Best practices for effective UAT**
In order to achieve these goals, UAT needs to be conducted thoughtfully. These best practices can help you administer effective UAT: 

**Define and write down your acceptance criteria.** 
Acceptance criteria are pre-established standards or requirements that a product, service, or process must meet. Write down these requirements for each item that you intend to test. For example, if your project is to create a new employee handbook for your small business, you may set acceptance criteria that the handbook must be a digital PDF that is accessible on mobile devices and desktop.

**Create the test cases for each item that you are testing.**
A test case is a sequence of steps and its expected results. It usually consists of a series of actions that the user can perform to find out if the product, service, or process behaved the way it was supposed to. Continuing with the employee handbook example, you could create a test case process in which the user would click to download the PDF of the handbook on their mobile device or desktop to ensure that they could access it without issues.

**Select your users carefully.** 
It is important to choose users who will actually be the end users of the product, service, or process. 

**Write the UAT scripts based on user stories.** 
These scripts will be delivered to the users during the testing process. A user story is an informal, general explanation of a feature written from the perspective of the end user. In our employee handbook example, a user story might be: As a new employee, I want to be able to use the handbook to easily locate the vacation policy and share it with my team via email. 

**Communicate with users and let them know what to expect.** 
If you can prepare users ahead of time, there will be fewer questions, issues, or delays during the testing process.

**Prepare the testing environment for UAT.** 
Ensure that the users have proper credentials and access, and try out these credentials ahead of time to ensure they work. 

**Provide a step-by-step plan to help guide users through the testing process.**
It will be helpful for users to have some clear, easy-to-follow instructions that will help focus their attention on the right places. You can create this plan in a digital document or spreadsheet and share with them ahead of time. 

**Compile notes in a single document and record any issues that are discovered.** 
You can create a digital spreadsheet or document that corresponds to your plan. It can have designated areas to track issues for each item that is tested, including the users’ opinions on the severity of each issue. This will help you prioritize fixes. 

**Managing UAT feedback**
Users provide feedback after performing UAT. This feedback might include positive comments, bug reports, and change requests. As the project manager, you can address the different types of feedback as follows:

**Bugs or issues:** Users might report technical issues, also known as bugs, or other types of issues after performing UAT. You can track and monitor these issues in a spreadsheet or equivalent system and prioritize which issues to fix. For instance, critical issues, such as not being able to access, download, or search the employee handbook, need to be prioritized over non-critical issues, such as feedback on the cover art of the handbook. 

**Change requests:** Sometimes the user might suggest minor changes to the product, service, or process after UAT. These types of requests or changes should also be managed and prioritized. Depending on the type and volume of the requests, you may want to share this data with your primary stakeholders, and you may also need to adjust your project timeline to implement these new requests. 

**Key takeaway**
User acceptance testing is a powerful tool to ensure that your project outcome is desirable and successful. Be sure to leave time in the schedule for proper testing and issue resolution.

### Common data metrics for project management
There are many types of project data you can use to determine your team’s progress and efficiency, evaluate the success of your project, and inform project decisions. While you don't need to be a data expert, knowing how to measure, track, and evaluate the right kind of data will help you deliver the most value and impact. 

This reading will recap some of the common types of data from the previous video and introduce a few more key data points that can help you manage projects and work with stakeholders. This reading will also introduce a few ways to interpret the data so that you can reduce risks and make the right decisions about your teams and projects.

**The benefits of analyzing data in project management**
A hand pointing at one of the bars in a bar chart.
As a project manager, you can use data daily to make better decisions, solve problems, improve performance and processes, and understand your users. 

For example, if you have data on customer buying patterns, you can identify your best-selling products, and you'll be able to make smarter decisions when placing new product orders with your suppliers. This data will also help you better understand your users and their preferences so you can improve your product offerings and performance. 

You can also use project team data to help you refine your processes. For example, if your team is experiencing an issue, analyzing data from your project tracker about the number of tasks completed, escalations, or internal process problems can help you find the source. This will allow you to make an informed decision about where to focus your efforts to improve processes.

Through critical analysis, application, and execution, data becomes a powerful tool to guide any project in the right direction.

**Data, metrics, and analytics**
Three images to represent data, metrics and analyticsThree images: Numbers grouped in a circle to represent data; a graph with rulers lining the x and y axis to represent metrics; two people working on a puzzle to represent analytics.
Data is information. It’s the numbers and feedback available to you about different aspects of your project. Metrics are how you measure your data. They define the important or specific information (data) you need to know about your project, such as productivity, quality, or engagement. Once you determine your project's metrics, you analyze the data according to those metrics to find patterns and answer questions about your project. This process is called analytics: using data to answer questions, discover relationships, and predict unknown outcomes. 

**When analyzing data, ask:** What do the metrics mean to you? How do you want to use the metrics you've chosen? Can you find patterns to make predictions about your project? Can you find ways to improve—or optimize—certain aspects of your project? What lessons can you draw from your project's data?

The next few sections are some common categories of metrics used in project management and a brief explanation of what they are and how they're useful to a project. Keep in mind that your use of different metrics isn’t limited to these categories. All of your project data is interrelated. The same metric can also provide different information when applied to different aspects of your project.

**Productivity metrics**
A calendar and clock to represent productivity
Productivity metrics typically measure progress and output over time. They allow you to track—or predict—the effectiveness and efficiency of your project team. 

To track your team's productivity over time, analyze the number of tasks or milestones completed in a given time frame. Ask questions like, what percentage of tasks are completed on time, and how long do they usually take? Or, if tasks were not completed on time, how much longer than anticipated did it take to complete all the tasks?

On-time completion rates can help illustrate to clients and stakeholders how the project is progressing and when they can expect certain deliverables to be ready. If your project's completion rates are high, it means you're doing a good job of meeting your completion goals. If the rates are low, it means you're missing deadlines. Analyzing data can help you make decisions about things like improving or implementing new processes, or re-evaluating how you estimate project scope, complexity, and timeline.

**Calculating duration (how long something takes)** can be useful for setting and evaluating tasks and milestones and determining if you'll meet project deadlines. Tracking task duration can improve the accuracy of estimating a project's timeline. This data is broken down into hours, days, weeks, months, and sometimes years. 

You can also analyze current information to predict future outcomes and make projections (or forecasts) about productivity trends, project durations, costs, performance or quality. This kind of data empowers you to proactively manage your project and its resources and measure the accuracy of your projections over time. For example, analyzing your team's overall performance or velocity can answer questions such as, is the team completing its tasks and milestones? What percentage of tasks is the team finishing on time?

Predicting the future may be impossible, but building a better understanding of it and refining your method for making projections is achievable and valuable.

**Quality metrics**
A clipboard with a check mark 
Quality metrics relate to achieving acceptable outcomes and can include metrics such as number of changes, issues, and cost variance, all of which affect quality.

Changes refer to differences in any aspect of the project from what was originally planned or required. Issues are problems that may affect task completion—and often result in a change. Track the number of changes and issues to identify patterns, refine processes, and share information about the project with stakeholders.

Cost or budget variance is the difference between the actual amount of money spent on a project and the amount that was budgeted for the project. Over time, this data can help you understand how well you're estimating budgets for your projects. A low variance means you've estimated your project budget accurately. A high variance means you should reevaluate your estimation process. You could be under- or over-estimating costs for your budget, or you may not be tracking expenses effectively.

**Happiness and satisfaction**
Two people smiling and giving a high-five
Project managers at Google use a sub-set of metrics called happiness metrics that also relate to quality. These are metrics that relate to different aspects of the user's overall satisfaction with a product or service, like visual appeal, how likely they are to recommend, and ease of use. Happiness metrics can generally be captured with a well-designed survey or by tracking revenue generated, customer retention, or product returns. 

**Customer satisfaction** scores reflect user attitudes, satisfaction, or perceived ease of use. These scores measure how well the project delivered what it set out to do and how well it satisfies customer and stakeholder needs. Customer satisfaction scores generally represent a combined metric—the sum of several different happiness metrics. For example, on a satisfaction survey, a customer might separately rate a product's appearance as 6/10, ease of use as 7/10, and likeness to recommend or use again as 8/10. The overall customer satisfaction score would then be 7/10. 

You will need to determine what scores are acceptable for your project by discussing with stakeholders what the most important aspects of the project are. 

**Adoption and engagement**

Another set of metrics related to quality are adoption and engagement. Adoption refers to whether or not a product, service or process is accepted and used. Engagement refers to the degree to which it is used—the frequency of use, amount of time spent using it, and the range of use. It might help to think of these in terms of throwing a party: your adoption metrics would reveal to you whether or not people accepted the invitation and showed up. The engagement metrics would tell you how active they were at the party—whether they participated in activities or interacted with other attendees, if they invited their friends to come with them, and how long they stayed. 

Adoption metrics for a product or service release, like an app, software program, delivery service, or gym membership, would be similar to the party example. However, they can be a bit more complex if you need to track metrics for more than one thing, like whether users make additional purchases or sign up for premium features. 

Each project will need to define its own set of successful adoption metrics, such as:

Conversion rates

Time to value (TTV)

Onboarding completion rates

Frequency of purchases

Providing feedback (rating the product or service)

Completing a profile

Engagement metrics tell you to what degree a product, service, or process is being used. They reveal the frequency and type of customer interaction and participation over time. Engagement metrics might include the daily usage rate of a design feature or tracking orders and customer interactions. 

As a project manager, you're not only concerned with the end user's level of engagement. It's just as important to monitor stakeholder and team member engagement as well. Measuring stakeholder participation by tracking the frequency of communication, responses to emails or updates, attendance at meetings, or level of input can give you a sense of whether or not stakeholders are finding value in the project. A lack of meaningful engagement could put your project at risk. Stakeholders may not be aware of changes or the overall progress of the project, and therefore the final outcome of the project may not meet their expectations. Measuring team member engagement is vital to the success of your project because the more engaged they are, the more productive they are, and the more likely they are to produce high-quality results. 

Ideally, you want your adoption and engagement metrics to increase or to at least meet the goal metrics that were established with stakeholders earlier in the project.  If there is no increase, or the metrics drop, then your rates are low and therefore not as successful. Check out the resources below for a more in-depth understanding of how and why to measure adoption and engagement.

**Key takeaway**
Data, metrics and analytics are all important to the success of your project. You'll need to have some familiarity with how to collect and measure data, and how to use the data to tell you about different aspects of your project. Depending on the project and its unique goals, some metrics will be more important than others. It's your job to make sure you understand which metrics your stakeholders are most interested in and what elements impact your team's ability to deliver quality results on time and within budget.

### The six steps of data analysis
In an earlier video, you learned that data analysis is the process of collecting and organizing information to help draw conclusions, solve problems, make informed decisions, and support your goals. In this reading, we will go over the key parts of the data analysis process. 

There are six main steps involved in data analysis: Ask, prepare, process, analyze, share and act. Let’s break these down one by one. 

**Icon for "Ask"**
During the Ask phase, ask key questions to help frame your analysis, starting with: What is the problem? When defining the problem, look at the current state of the business and identify how it is different from the ideal state. Usually, there is an obstacle in the way or something wrong that needs to be fixed.  At this stage, you want to be as specific as possible. You also want to stay focused on the problem itself, not just the symptoms. For example, imagine you are doing data analysis for a gym that is losing memberships. You could ask: Why do we keep losing members? But a better and more specific question would be: What factors are negatively impacting the member experience? That way, when you set off to do your research, you know exactly what to look for.

Another part of the Ask stage is identifying your stakeholders and understanding their expectations. There can be lots of stakeholders on a project, and each of them can make decisions, influence actions, and weigh in on strategies. Each stakeholder will also have specific goals they want to meet. It is pretty common for a stakeholder to come to you with a problem that needs solving. But before you begin your analysis, you need to be clear about what they are asking of you. For example, if your manager assigns you a project related to analyzing the gym’s business risk, it would be a good idea to confirm whether they want you to analyze all types of risks that could affect the gym or just risks related to weather or seasonal trends.

**Icon for "prepare"**
After you have a clear direction, it is time to move to the Prepare stage. This is where you collect and store the data you will use for the upcoming analysis process. 

Let’s turn back to our gym membership example. To collect data on the member experience, you decide to send surveys to the gym’s members asking for feedback about their experience. To make sure you get specific answers, you ask them to offer feedback in three distinct categories: upkeep of the facility, customer service, and membership cost. You also leave room for them to write in a response. When you get the member surveys back, it is important that you have an organized system for tracking and filing them.   

**Icon for "Process"**
This stage is when it is time to Process your data. In this step, you will “clean” your data, which means you will enter your data into a spreadsheet, or another tool of your choice, and eliminate any inconsistencies and inaccuracies that can get in the way of results.  While collecting data, be sure to get rid of any duplicate responses or biased data. This helps you know that any decisions made from the analysis are based on facts and that they are fair and unbiased. For example, if you noticed duplicate responses from a single gym member when sorting through the surveys, you would need to get rid of the copies to be sure your data set is accurate.  

During this stage, it is also important to check the data you prepared to make sure it is complete and correct and that there are no typos or other errors. 

**icon for "analyze"**
Now it is time to Analyze. In this stage, you take a close look at your data to draw conclusions, make predictions, and decide on next steps. Here, you will transform and organize the data in a way that highlights the full scope of the results so you can figure out what it all means. You can create visualizations using charts and graphs to determine if there are any trends or patterns within the data or any need for additional research. 

In our gym membership example, let’s say you notice 50% of the members wrote in an additional response on the survey citing that the equipment is outdated. The survey also showed that 75% of the responses cited  “expensive membership fees.” When looking at the 50% of responses citing “outdated equipment” and 75% of responses citing “expensive membership fees” side by side on a graph, you may be able to deduce that these responses inform one another. Members feel like the experience just isn’t worth the price. You might conclude that the gym should invest in new equipment if they want to keep members and add value to the membership fee. 

**Icon for "Share"**
Once you have asked questions to figure out the problem—then prepared, processed, and analyzed the data—it is time to Share your findings. In this stage, you use data visualization to organize your data in a format that is clear and digestible for your audience. When sharing, you can offer the insights you gained during your analysis to help stakeholders make effective, data-driven decisions for solving the problem. 

**Icon for "Act"**
And finally, you are ready to Act! In the final stage of your data analysis, the business takes all of the insights you have provided and puts them into action to solve the original business problem. 

Conducting a data analysis is an essential process for understanding a business’ needs and challenges and determining effective solutions. These six foundational steps—ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act—will help set you up for success!

### Different ways to visualize data
Earlier, we discussed best practices for collecting and analyzing data. When it is time to present your data to your audience, you don’t just want to tell them about your findings and what they mean, you want to show them. Data visualization helps us organize data and turn it into information that is clear and easy for our audience to digest.

In this reading, we will go over a variety of charts and graphs you can use to visually represent data. 

**Visualizing your data**
Before translating your data into a chart or graph, you should be clear on what you want to show your audience. Figure out what data you want to use and why. You might want to inform your audience about a new trend or a valuable piece of information, or show relationships between data sets. Or maybe you need to compare values, understand the composition of something, or analyze trends and behaviors over set periods of time. 

The type of data you have, and the information you want to show or understand, will help you figure out the right data visualization to use. Let's go over some scenarios and discuss which charts and graphs would be best for each.  

**Show relationships**
A scatter plot, sometimes referred to as a scatter chart or scatter graph, uses dots to represent values for two different variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots will sometimes have a line drawn across its center. This line is known as the trend line and highlights the direction the points are trending towards. 

Scatter plots show the relationship between data sets, and can help us understand the impact of one factor on another. For example, the scatterplot below shows the relationship between the life expectancy of people living in a country and how happy those people are. The first variable, the happiness score, is reflected on the vertical axis —also called the y-axis. The second variable, life expectancy, is on the horizontal axis —also called the x-axis. By looking at this scatterplot, we can tell that as a person’s happiness score increases, so does their life expectancy.

Scatter plot best practices: 
Start the y-axis at 0 to represent data accurately.

**Comparing values**
Bar graphs use size contrast to compare two or more values. In the example below, the time of day is compared to someone’s level of motivation throughout the whole work day. By comparing this data, we can tell that this person’s motivation is low at the beginning of the work day, and gets higher and higher by the end. Bar graphs are also a great way to clarify trends and identify patterns.

Bar graph best practices:
Use consistent colors throughout the chart

Use accent colors to highlight important data points or changes over time

Use horizontal labels so it is easier to read 

**Demonstrating composition** 
Now let’s check out another visualization you will probably recognize—the pie chart. Pie charts show us the composition of something. In other words, how much each part of something makes up the whole. The pie chart below shows us all the activities that make up someone’s day. Half of it is spent working, which is shown by the amount of space that the blue section takes up. From a quick glance at this pie chart, you can easily tell which activities make up a good chunk of the day and which ones take up less time.

Pie chart best practices: 
Avoid including too many categories so it is easy to compare slices

Make sure that the slice values add up to 100%

Order slices according to their size

**Analyzing trends and behaviors** 
Tracking trends can help us understand shifts or changes in our data. Line graphs are a great tool for visually showing change over time, but they can be paired with other factors, too. In the line graph below, we are using two lines to compare the popularity of cats and dogs over a period of time. Because the graph is using two different line colors, we can instantly tell that dogs are more popular than cats. We will talk more about using colors and patterns to make visualizations more accessible to audiences later, too. Even as the lines move up and down, there is a general trend upwards, and the line for dogs always stays higher than the line for cats.

Line graph best practices:
To avoid clutter, don't show more than four categories.

Organize highly variable data at the top of the chart to make it easy to read
